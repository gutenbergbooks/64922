    <h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span> word &ldquo;fireworks&rdquo; as a metaphor, used either
    to describe the higher flights of oratory, of literature,
    or of human strife, whether it be in Parliament or
    the Parish Hall, or merely descriptive of domestic discord, is
    familiar, even threadbare.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the metaphor has generally a humorous flavour;
    why is this? Is there anything inherently comic about fireworks?
    It is true that for a short season the less critical of the
    comic papers used the cracker and squib as pegs upon which
    to hang the type of joke which depends for its success on the
    atavistic human trait of laughing at the misfortune or discomfort
    of others, but this is the lowest type of humour
    which soon palls upon the mind.</p>

  <p>The Stage also has its comedy and clown, yet the mention
    of the stage is not a signal for mirth. Can any who have heard
    the long-drawn Ah-h! of rapture from many thousand throats,
    at the bursting of a flight of shell, or the darting up of the
    wonderfully tinted rays of the &ldquo;Magical Illumination&rdquo; at
    the Crystal Palace, maintain that the most dramatic moment
    on the stage is more affecting to the spectators?</p>

  <p>Pyrotechny is possibly the only art which can compete with
    nature; anyone who has seen a first-class firework display will
    admit that for impressive grandeur, colour effects, and contrasts
    of light and shade, pyrotechny is unapproached.</p>

  <p>Pyrotechny paints on the canvas of the sky; and the results
    are at once the joy and despair of the artist. Many artists have
    tried to record their impressions, but the results have been
    generally disappointing. Whistler came near success, but even
    his wonderful work conveys merely the dying embers of passed
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span>glory. One feels that here has been a magnificent display, but
    the scene in its full grandeur is not depicted.</p>

  <p>One of the few black-and-white artists who can approach
    the subject with some success is Mr. C. M. Padday, an example
    of whose work is reproduced in the following pages. His
    success comes from a careful study of the subject, both technically
    and from the point of view of composition.</p>

  <p>That fireworks are popular there is no doubt; no form of
    amusement is capable of giving enjoyment to so many people
    at one time; there is no entertainment which so appeals to
    youth and age of all classes and tastes. And yet it is doubtful
    if there is an industry concerning which the public at large
    is so profoundly ignorant.</p>

  <p>To the average onlooker any firework which rises in the air
    is a rocket, any that revolve are catherine wheels; both of
    these assumptions are incorrect.</p>

  <p>What is the average conception of a firework factory? A
    building, let us say, in which workmen, with sleeves rolled up,
    are busily engaged in shovelling heaps of gunpowder. How
    many know that a firework factory consists of dozens of small
    buildings, the construction of which is exactly defined by
    law, separated by spaces also specified by law; that workmen
    may not roll up their sleeves in the danger buildings; or
    that the amount of gunpowder in each building is strictly
    limited to a small quantity? All of these restrictions being
    enforced with the view, of course, of limiting the effects of
    any explosion that may occur.</p>

  <p>So far as I am aware, no history of the art has yet been
    written. It is true that during the nineteenth century many
    text-books on pyrotechny were written, but the historical
    side of the subject has been generally represented by a few
    disjointed remarks in the prefaces.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv">xv</a></span></p>
  <p>My object has not been to write a text-book on firework-making,
    but rather to trace the art from earliest times, and to
    give a description of the development and process of manufacture.
    For those interested in the subject, and desiring fuller
    information, the list of MSS. and books given in the Bibliography
    at the end of this volume may be found useful.</p>

  <p>My excuse for adding another volume to the literature of
    the art is that I am of the eighth generation of a family of
    pyrotechnists, whose work, I venture to claim, has not been
    without its effect. If I succeed in interesting, and in some
    degree enlightening, my readers, I shall feel I have not written
    in vain; if I fail, I shall know it is not in my choice of subject
    but in my capacity for dealing with it.</p>

      THE ORIGIN OF PYROTECHNY</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Pyrotechny</span>, or the Art of Firework-making, is
    of great antiquity, and the date of its origin is quite
    unknown; indeed, it would be impossible to define
    with any degree of exactitude what actually constitutes a
    firework.</p>

  <p>It is curious how universal is the belief that fireworks were
    dependent upon the invention or discovery of gunpowder.
    Very little consideration will prove the fallacy of this view; in
    fact, will show that the reverse is probably the case. In India
    and China saltpetre (or nitrate of potash) is found in large
    quantities, and was, no doubt, used by the primitive inhabitants
    in far-off times for such purposes as curing meat,
    cooking, etc. The dropping of a quantity in the camp fire
    may have attracted the attention of some early inventor to the
    extent of starting him on a series of what were probably the
    earliest chemical experiments.</p>

  <p>He would notice that the presence of saltpetre made the
    fire burn brighter, and its use as a tinder maker would
    suggest itself by mixing it with some substance which he knew
    to be combustible. The most common fuel he knew of was
    wood, but it must be a powder to mix evenly with saltpetre.
    Wood is not easily reduced to powder; saws had not been
    invented, so that he could not add sawdust, and the nearest
    thing he could get would be charcoal from the fire, which
    could easily be reduced to powder. With this mixture he would
    be well on the way to success in elementary pyrotechny.</p>

  <p>The next step in his career as the first pyrotechnist is to
    utilise his composition as an easy means of making fire.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>Gradually he gives up his hitherto necessary tasks of hunting
    and trapping, as he receives the fruits of other labours in return
    for his services as fire-maker to the tribe.</p>

  <p>The most important item in early social life is fire, the
    implements for producing it the most valued property of the
    tribe; it was the focus of religion and the centre of daily
    existence, so that any new phenomenon connected with fire
    would be of the greatest interest to primitive people, and any
    short cut to the production of fire would be accorded more
    perseverance and care in its perfection than almost any other
    invention.</p>

  <p>Fire would be struck with a piece of iron pyrites on a flint,
    small pieces of reguline particles of iron would be detached
    and fall on the fire mixture unlit. Afterwards, when combustion
    of the mass of fire mixture took place, these small
    pieces of metal would scintillate as do the iron filings in a
    modern firework composition. This would give rise to a further
    series of experiments, and gradually the composition known
    as Chinese Fire would be evolved, which is known to have
    been in use in the East from remote times.</p>

  <p>Having arrived at a pyrotechnic composition, attempt to
    use it in other ways besides fire-making would naturally
    follow, and sooner or later the idea of filling the mixture into
    tubes would suggest itself, especially as both in India and
    China (in one of which countries pyrotechny undoubtedly
    originated) a serviceable tube&mdash;or to use the modern term
    &ldquo;case&rdquo;&mdash;was ready to hand in any size or quantity in the
    ubiquitous bamboo. The bamboo is in use for the purpose
    at the present day in the East, and until recent times, when
    displaced by European weapons, was used in the construction
    of ordnance of considerable size. Mortars used for throwing
    firework shell up to six or more inches in diameter are still in
    use in Japan and China, the barrel consisting of a section of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>bamboo strengthened on the outside with a binding of split
    cane.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illow58" id="i004" style="max-width: 52.5em">
    <img src="images/i004.jpg" class="w100" width="707" height="1200" alt="Japanese print 2" />
  </div>

  <p>Having reached the point of charging composition into a
    tube, that is to say confining it, a more or less violent explosion
    was likely or rather certain to follow during the course of the
    experiments, which might suggest the use of a tube as a means
    of discharging a projectile. This would lead to research in the
    direction of the best composition for the purpose and the
    evolution of gunpowder.</p>

  <p>It must be remembered that the constituents of gunpowder
    must be present in approximately exact proportion,
    whereas with primitive pyrotechnic compositions, if the
    ingredients saltpetre and charcoal are present, it is almost
    impossible to fail in getting some result.</p>

  <p>The above suggestion must not be taken literally as a statement
    of fact, but rather as an attempt on the part of the writer
    to trace the stages by which pyrotechnic and explosive compositions
    came to be evolved.</p>

  <p>If one disabuses one&rsquo;s mind of the curiously widespread
    belief that all fireworks are composed chiefly of gunpowder,
    and that without the invention of gunpowder fireworks could
    not have been constructed, it seems far more likely that
    pyrotechny is based on the discovery of the assistance given to
    combustion by saltpetre, than on the discovery of gunpowder.</p>

    writer is strongly of opinion that the discovery of pyrotechnic
    compositions antedated that of gunpowder. In many cases
    earlier writers have discovered passages which they consider
    prove the use of firearms and gunpowder; in reality these
    refer to Greek-fire and similar compositions, which were
    used as projectiles, being thrown from machines or catapults,
    and not as propellants. Gunpowder as a mixture of ingredients
    may have been known from remote times, as undoubtedly
    were other simple pyrotechnic compositions, but all evidence
    goes to show that its use as a propellant was not known until
    well into the Christian Era.</p>

  <p>The composition Greek-fire, known in ancient times as
    &ldquo;naphtha,&rdquo; was a mixture of pitch, resin, and sulphur, with
    the addition in some cases of crude saltpetre. It may be considered
    that in the absence of the latter ingredient the mixture
    does not constitute a pyrotechnic composition, but from the
    description of the use of &ldquo;naphtha&rdquo; in early writings, it
    appears at least likely that it was generally present.</p>

  <p>The fire was either enclosed in hollow stones or iron vessels,
    and thrown from a catapult, or sometimes filled into the
    end of arrows and assisted to propel them forward or sustain
    their flight.</p>

  <p>Philostratus (170–250 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>), writing of the Indian Campaign
    of Alexander the Great (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 326), relates that the inhabitants
    of a town on the river Hyphasis (Beas) &ldquo;defended
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>themselves by means of lightning and thunder, which darted
    upon their besiegers.&rdquo; This has been considered as evidence
    of the use of firearms, but is more probably the first reference
    to Greek-fire. Greek-fire or &ldquo;naphtha&rdquo; was used at the
    defence of Constantinople between 660 and 667.</p>

  <p>At the siege of Pian-King Lo-Yang (1232), as mentioned
    in the Chinese Annals, iron pots were thrown containing a
    burning substance which could spread fire over half an acre,
    and described by the historians as the &ldquo;thunder which shakes
    heaven.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Mongolians attacking Bagdad in the year 1258 made
    use of similar vessels, also fire arrows. Marco Polo, describing
    sieges of towns in China 1268 to 1273, mentions the throwing
    of fire.</p>

  <p>In most of the early records although noise is remarked
    upon, it is apparently while the projectile is in the air or upon
    impact; this disposes of the impression which many writers
    have formed that firearms are referred to, there being no
    reference to an initial explosion.</p>

  <p>Sir George Stanton, writing in 1798 of his embassy to the
    Emperor of China, says that &ldquo;nitre (saltpetre) is the daily
    produce of China and India, and there accordingly the knowledge
    of gunpowder seems coeval with that of the most distant
    historic events. Among the Chinese it has been applied at all
    times to useful purposes ... and to amusement in making
    a vast variety of fireworks&mdash;but its force had not been directed
    through strong metallic tubes, as it was by Europeans soon
    after they had discovered that composition.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Although the place of origin of the art, pyrotechny has not
    developed in the East as rapidly as in Europe, except in Japan.</p>

  <p>Japanese pyrotechnists, with that wonderful capacity for
    careful and exact manual work which is so characteristic of
    the race, have developed aerial fireworks, that is to say, the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>shell, to a remarkable degree of perfection. The compositions
    used are not to be compared with European manufactures in
    point of colour or brilliance, but the effects obtained are extraordinary.
    The stars, upon the bursting of the shell, are thrown
    out in symmetrical patterns and designs, several examples
    of which are given in the accompanying Japanese colour prints.</p>

  <p>Daylight fireworks also originated in Japan. Instead of
    pyrotechnic effects, the shell contains a grotesque balloon
    in the form of an animal, human figure, or other form, which,
    being open and weighted at the lower end, becomes inflated
    as it falls and remains in the air for a considerable period.
    Other daylight effects are coloured clouds formed by coloured
    powder, distributed by the bursting of the shell, showers of
    streamers, confetti, and toys.</p>

  <p>Chinese firework displays have often been enthusiastically
    described by travellers in China. Whether it is that the glamour
    of the East distorts the perceptions, or that these travellers
    have not seen a European firework display, there is no doubt
    that such descriptions are, to say the least, over coloured.</p>

  <p>Chinese fire (a composition of saltpetre, iron filings, sulphur
    and charcoal), a few simple colour compositions, and a large
    number of Chinese crackers of varying sizes constitute a
    Chinese display; the rest of the exhibition being eked out
    with lanterns, pictures, etc., which certainly do not come
    under the heading of pyrotechnics.</p>

  <p>The writer once had an opportunity of witnessing a
    Chinese display of some importance, lasting several hours,
    which produced the effect on the mind of watching some
    performance or game of the rules of which one was in entire
    ignorance. Pyrotechnically, only the crudest effects were
    produced, the remainder of the display, consisting of such
    items as a man slowly climbing a ladder carrying a lantern,
    was to the uninitiated mystifying.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illow58" id="i008" style="max-width: 52.5em">

  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

  <p>The following is an account by a traveller in the early
    nineteenth century of a Chinese display: &ldquo;The fireworks,
    in some particulars,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;exceeded anything of the kind
    I had ever seen. In grandeur, magnificence, and variety they
    were, I own, inferior to the Chinese fireworks we had seen
    at Batavia, but infinitely superior in point of novelty, neatness
    and ingenuity of contrivance. One piece of machinery I
    greatly admired: a green chest, five feet square, was hoisted
    up by a pulley fifty or sixty feet from the ground, the bottom
    of which was so contrived as then suddenly to fall out, and
    make way for twenty or thirty strings of lanterns, enclosed in
    a box, to descend from it, unfolding themselves from one
    another by degrees, so as at last to form a collection of full
    five hundred, each having a light of a beautifully coloured
    flame burning brightly within it. This devolution and development
    of lanterns was several times repeated, and at every
    time exhibiting a difference of colour and figure. On each
    side was a correspondence of smaller boxes, which opened in
    like manner as the other, and let down an immense network
    of fire, with divisions and compartments of various forms
    and dimensions, round and square, hexagons, octagons, etc.,
    which shone like the brightest burnished copper, and flashed
    like prismatic lightnings, with every impulse of the wind.
    The whole concluded with a volcano, or general explosion
    and discharge of suns and stars, squibs, crackers, rockets and
    grenades, which involved the gardens for an hour in a cloud
    of intolerable smoke. The diversity of colour, with which the
    Chinese have the secret of clothing their fire, seems one of
    the chief merits of their pyrotechny.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It will be seen that lanterns play an important part in the
    exhibition, and that when the fireworks proper are reached,
    the result is an &ldquo;intolerable smoke.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Indian pyrotechnists are more advanced than their Chinese
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>neighbours. Firework displays carried out by them are nowadays
    more or less crude attempts to reproduce European work.</p>

  <p>The writer has seen a set piece evidently intended to
    follow a fire picture seen in a European display carried out
    by small wicks burning in oil instead of the &ldquo;lances,&rdquo; as the
    small fireworks used to outline the pictures are called in this
    country.</p>

  <p>In India as in China fireworks play a frequent part in
    religious and civil ceremonies. In the former country, at
    certain festivals, a primitive device for producing a series of
    reports is used. These are called &ldquo;adirvedis,&rdquo; and consist of
    a series of short iron tubes fitted to a wooden plank, charged
    with gunpowder and tamped with clay.</p>

  <p>At weddings, crackers are largely used under a variety of
    names, such as Vengagvedi, Gola, Pataka or Koroo. To-day
    these are simple crackers filled with country-made gunpowder
    or the imported Chinese crackers. Formerly almost the only
    composition used was chlorate of potash and one of the sulphides
    of arsenic. A favourite form consisted of a small quantity
    of the two ingredients put together unmixed into a piece of
    rag with some small stones or grit and tied. The resulting
    fireworks were similar to the &ldquo;throw-down&rdquo; crackers sold
    in this country.</p>

  <p>Owing to the very large number of accidents caused by
    the casual methods, both in manufacture and use, with this
    highly sensitive composition, H.M. Chief Inspector of
    Explosives for India endeavoured, in 1902, to secure its
    prohibition, as was done in this country in 1895, but it was
    not until 1910, when it had been established that this composition
    was being used by anarchists, that it was finally
    prohibited.</p>

  <p>The most successful effect produced by Hindoo pyrotechnists
    is the &ldquo;Tubri.&rdquo; The composition is here known as
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>Chinese fire, a mixture of charcoal, saltpetre, sulphur and iron
    dust, charged into either bamboo tubes or earthen pots.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illow58" id="i010" style="max-width: 52.5em">
    <img src="images/i010.jpg" class="w100" width="702" height="1200" alt="Japanese print 5" />
  </div>

  <p>It is a common practice to fix a pot at either end of a long
    bamboo, which is whirled quickly about by a performer; the
    result produced is quite good, but seems rather to come under
    the heading of juggling than that of pyrotechnics proper. As
    the pots are theoretically the wrong shape for such a purpose,
    that is to say, a large mass of composition is burning through
    a narrow orifice, premature explosions are frequent. This
    want of theoretical knowledge is noticeable throughout, but
    such incidents seem to be appreciated as part of the show.</p>

  <p>Another use of the earth pot is the &ldquo;burusu,&rdquo; a kind of red
    flare; the composition used being sulphur, saltpetre, and
    nitrate of strontia. Flare compositions are also used loose as
    in England, and are known as &ldquo;chandrajota&rdquo; or &ldquo;mahteb.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Abusavanani or Hawai, that is to say, rockets, are now
    made similarly to those manufactured in Europe except a
    bamboo case is most generally used, but formerly chlorate
    of potash and orpiment seem to have been employed for this
    purpose.</p>

  <p>The firework shell under the name &ldquo;out&rdquo; is also manufactured
    very much as in this country, except that the range
    of effects is very limited, simple coloured stars being almost
    the only &ldquo;garniture&rdquo; used.</p>

  <p>In Siam it is a custom, and one apparently of considerable
    antiquity, to celebrate certain religious festivals with firework
    displays. These displays take place in the day-time, and take
    the form of discharges of rockets, some of which are of very
    large size; a writer giving their length, exclusive of the stick,
    as from 8 ft. to 10 ft. The case is composed of a section of
    bamboo bound with string. The composition consists of coarse
    native powder, of which from 20 lbs. to 30 lbs. is often used
    in one case. The rocket stick, which is of bamboo, varying
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>from 20 ft. to 40 ft. in length, is gaily decorated with coloured
    paper and tinsel and fitted with bamboo whistles. A rough
    scaffold is erected from which to fire the rockets, and according
    to those who have witnessed such exhibitions, considerable
    altitudes are reached by the rockets in flight. As may be
    expected with such crude methods, mishaps are of frequent
    occurrence.</p>

      PYROTECHNY IN EUROPE</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Pyrotechnic</span> compositions and gunpowder are
    inextricably mixed together in early European records;
    for our inquiries it will serve no useful purpose to
    disentangle them, the latter being only a particular case of
    the former. We will therefore deal with them together, taking
    the evidence of the knowledge of one as that of both,
    as until gunpowder is specifically mentioned as being used as
    a propellant in a gun or similar weapon, there is nothing to
    distinguish it from any other pyrotechnic composition.</p>

  <p>The earliest record of European pyrotechny is in Claudius&rsquo;
    account of the public festivities during the consulate of
    Theodosius in the fourth century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, in which he describes
    fire &ldquo;which ran about in different directions over the planks
    without burning or even charring them, and which formed by
    their twisting and turning globes of fire.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Leo <abbr title="the sixth">VI</abbr>, Emperor of the East, in a work written about
    <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 900, says: &ldquo;We have divers ways of destroying the
    enemies&rsquo; ships, as by means of fire prepared in tubes, from
    which they issue with a sound of thunder, and with a fiery
    smoke that burns the vessels on which they are hurled. A
    tube of tin must be put on the front of the ship to hurl this
    from.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The most interesting reference of an early date is supposed
    to have been written by Marcus Graecus in his &ldquo;<span lang="la">Liber
      ignium ad comburendos hostes</span>&rdquo; (Book of fires for burning
    up the enemy), in which he not only gives the exact proportions
    of the compositions, but describes what is virtually
    the modern cracker, and also a primitive form of rocket. The
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>case of the former was only partially filled, as with the
    jumping cracker of to-day, and although the wording is not
    very explicit, it was apparently bent in a similar way.</p>

  <p>The date of this work is a subject of controversy; some
    writers place it as early as the eighth century, and it can only
    be said with certainty that it is not later than 1280. The latter
    date is fixed by the death of Albertus Magnus, who, in his
    book &ldquo;<span lang="la">De miribilibus mundi</span>,&rdquo; from internal evidence, is
    obviously plagiarising the <span lang="la">Liber Ignium</span>.</p>

  <p>Friar Roger Bacon (1214–94), in two of his works, refers
    at least twice to compositions containing saltpetre, powdered
    charcoal, and sulphur. In one place he refers to fires that
    &ldquo;shall burn at what distance we please&rdquo;; in another to
    &ldquo;thunder and corruscations,&rdquo; which references seem to
    suggest that he is describing something of a pyrotechnic
    nature rather than the simple effect of gunpowder. His
    description in no way indicates that he claimed to be the
    inventor, but rather as something well known before.</p>

  <p>Dr. Jebb, in his preface to Bacon&rsquo;s &ldquo;<span lang="la">Opus Majus</span>,&rdquo; refers
    to what seems to be an early example of both the rocket and
    the cracker.</p>

  <p>Dutens, in his &ldquo;Inquiries into the Origin of the discoveries
    attributed to the Moderns&rdquo; (1790), makes reference to
    many early writers, which are mostly so vague and exaggerated
    that no definite conclusion can be drawn from them;
    most refer to the early uses of Greek-fire or similar composition.</p>

  <p>Don Pedro, Bishop of Leon, says that &ldquo;in 1343, in a sea
    combat between the King of Tunis and the Moorish King of
    Seville ... those of Tunis had certain iron tubes or barrels
    wherewith they threw thunderbolts of fire.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This description, if accurate, may be thought to suggest
    the use of cannons, but it is more likely to refer to the use of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>Greek-fire; this composition will, in certain proportions, if
    charged into a strong tube, give intermittent bursts, projecting
    blazing masses of the mixture to a considerable distance.
    The writer has seen this effect produced in a steel mortar of
    5&frac12; inches diameter, the masses of composition being thrown a
    distance of upwards of a hundred yards, a considerable range
    in the days of close warfare. Anyone who has seen this phenomenon
    will at once realise that here probably is the true
    solution of many obscure early references to explain which
    so much ingenuity has been expended.</p>

  <p>An interesting fact which seems to have escaped the notice
    of writers on this subject is that Theresa, daughter of Alfonso
    <abbr title="the fifth">V</abbr>. King of Leon and the Asturias (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 999), when married
    to Abdallah, King of Toledo, took for device on her coat of
    arms a mortar in which a powder is being pounded. This
    powder is supposed to represent gunpowder, a supposition
    which is supported by the motto, &ldquo;<span lang="la">Minima maxima fecit</span>&rdquo;
    (A little makes much). If gunpowder is intended, this must
    be one of the earliest references to its quality of exploding,
    and it is difficult to explain the meaning otherwise.</p>

  <p>Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion used Greek-fire on his galley at
    the siege of Acre in 1191, and it is thought by many that it
    was introduced into Western Europe by the Crusaders, who
    had learned its use in the East.</p>

  <p>Alfonso Duke of Ferrara had as his coat of arms a bomb-shell
    in flight, and Antoine de Lalaing, Count of Hooghstraeten,
    had a bomb-shell exploding in water. The adoption
    of these two devices at about the same time (1540) seems to
    indicate that this projectile was coming into use, that is to
    say, for military purposes at least.</p>

  <p>An early reference to shell appears in Stowe&rsquo;s Chronicles
    (1565). He mentions two foreigners, Peter Brand and Peter
    Van Cullen, a gunsmith, in the employ of Henry <abbr title="the eighth">VIII</abbr> (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>1546), who &ldquo;caused to be made certain mortar pieces being
    at the mouth eleven inches unto nineteen inches wide, for
    the use whereof to be made certain hollow shot of cast-iron,
    to be stuffed with firework or wild-fire, whereof the bigger
    sort for the same had screws of iron to receive a match to
    carry fire kindled, that the firework might be set on fire for
    to break in pieces the same hollow shot, whereof the smallest
    piece hitting any man would kill or spoil him.&rdquo; The missile
    is to all intents the firework shell of the present day, except
    that the modern shell has a papier-maché case.</p>

  <p>The reference to &ldquo;firework&rdquo; without further explanation
    seems to indicate that by this time the word was well established
    in use. Shakespeare makes three references to fireworks.
    In &ldquo;Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost,&rdquo; Act <abbr title="5">V</abbr>, Scene 1, Don
    Armado says: &ldquo;The King would have me present the
    Princess with some delightful entertainment, or show, or
    pageant, or antic, or firework.&rdquo; In &ldquo;Henry <abbr title="the eighth">VIII</abbr>,&rdquo; Act <abbr title="1">I</abbr>,
    Scene 3, we read of &ldquo;fights and fireworks&rdquo;; and again in
    &ldquo;King John,&rdquo; Act <abbr title="2">II</abbr>, Scene 1: &ldquo;What cracker is this same
    that deafs our ears?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>However, nothing in the nature of a firework display
    appears to have taken place, at least in this country, before
    the time of Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>The use of fire for theatrical purposes, as in Mystery
    Plays to represent the &ldquo;gate of Hell,&rdquo; has been taken by
    some to refer to fireworks, but this seems doubtful as flames
    are mentioned, and it is more probable that a torch or similar
    contrivance was used.</p>

  <p>When, however, we read a description of a barge at the
    coronation of Anne Boleyn, in 1538, carrying a dragon
    &ldquo;casting forth wild fire&mdash;and men casting fire,&rdquo; the reference
    to some pyrotechnic effect, however primitive, seems fairly
    obvious.</p>
  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>
  <p>The men performers may be considered as early types of
    the &ldquo;green man&rdquo; who made his appearance somewhat later.
    The office of this performer was to head processions carrying
    &ldquo;fire clubs&rdquo; and scattering &ldquo;fireworks&rdquo; (probably sparks)
    to clear the way.</p>

  <p>One account of a procession to the Chester Races on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    George&rsquo;s Day, 1610, commences as follows: &ldquo;Two men in
    green ivy, set with work upon their other habit, with black
    hair and black beards, very ugly to behold, and garlands upon
    their heads, with great clubs in their hands, with fireworks
    to scatter abroad to maintain the way for the rest of the show.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The fire clubs referred to are described in John Bate&rsquo;s
    book, published in 1635; the same writer illustrates a &ldquo;green
    man&rdquo; on the title page of his work.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illow70" id="i016" style="max-width: 52.5em">
    <img src="images/i016.jpg" class="w100" width="843" height="1200" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Facsimile Title-page of Bate&rsquo;s Book, showing a &ldquo;Green Man.&rdquo;</div>
  </div>

  <p>Regarding the origin of the Green Man, it has been suggested
    that the character was evolved from the wild men,
    satyrs, monsters, etc., which appeared in the earlier exhibitions.
    This may or may not be so, but another explanation
    suggested to the writer by an old Danish print of the
    sixteenth century is at least plausible.</p>

  <p>This print, which apparently represents a floating firework
    device of the old scenic type, shows two figures carrying
    fire clubs wearing leaves, and suggesting immediately the
    green man of a slightly later date.</p>

  <p>Behind them are two figures holding rockets, leaving no
    doubt that a firework display is portrayed.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, apart from the fact that normally they
    have no fire issuing from their clubs, the supporters of the
    Danish royal arms might be here depicted; a supposition
    which is borne out by the fact that the figure surmounting
    the erection carries the crown and sceptre of Denmark.</p>

  <p>It seems quite within the bounds of possibility that these two
    figures were introduced into Danish displays as a compliment
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>to Royalty, and that later they appeared in England, and
    became, as it were, acclimatised. Colour is lent to this belief
    by the record of a display given on a float by the King of
    Denmark in 1606 upon his departure from this country, where
    he had been on a visit to his brother-in-law, James <abbr title="the first">I</abbr>.</p>

  <p>This exhibition seems to have given James a taste for
    fireworks, and one at least of the Danish artists appears to
    have remained in this country, as some months after James
    had a display carried out by &ldquo;a Dane, two Dutchmen, and
    Sir Thomas Challoner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In 1572 a firework display was given in the Temple Fields,
    Warwick, by the Earl of Warwick, then Master-General of
    the Ordnance. The occasion was a visit to the castle by Queen
    Elizabeth, who appears to have been rather partial to such
    exhibitions.</p>

  <p>The display consisted of a mimic battle, with two canvas
    forts for a setting; noise was provided by the discharge of
    ordnance of various sizes; the fireworks proper seem to
    have taken the form of flights of rockets. The display was
    evidently conducted in a somewhat reckless manner, some
    houses being set on fire, and some completely destroyed, the
    two inhabitants of which are said in a contemporary report
    to have been in bed and asleep, although how that could be
    with continuous discharge from twenty pieces of ordnance,
    to say nothing of &ldquo;qualivers and harquebuses,&rdquo; in the immediate
    neighbourhood, is to say the least curious.</p>

  <p>Two other displays attended by Elizabeth were those at
    Kenilworth in 1572 and at Elvetham in 1591.</p>

  <p>The first European people to make headway in the art of
    pyrotechny proper appear to have been the Italians. Vanochio,
    an Italian, in a work on artillery, dated 1572, attributes to the
    Florentines and Viennese the honour of being the first who
    made fireworks on erections of wood, decorated with statues
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>and pictures raised to a great height, some in Florence being
    forty ells, or seventy-two feet high. He adds that these were
    illuminated so that they might be seen from a distance, and
    that the statues threw out fire from the mouths and eyes.</p>

  <p>He refers to the practice, which survived up to the end of
    the eighteenth century, of constructing elaborate temples or
    palaces richly decorated, with transparencies illuminated
    from inside, statuary, gilding, floral and other decorations.
    On these erections the fireworks proper were displayed, and
    which were then called artificial fireworks. Nothing very
    large in the way of firework set-pieces seems to have been
    attempted, but effect was gained by repetition of a small
    device over the facade of the building.</p>

  <p>Displays were given annually in Florence at the Feast of
    <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John and the Assumption. This custom extended to Rome,
    where the festivals were given on the Feast of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter and
    <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul, and at the rejoicings on the election of a Pope.</p>

  <p>The towers and fortifications of the castle of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Angelo
    furnished suitable spots for these, being visible from the
    greater part of the city of Rome, and what are described as
    braziers, firepots, and other fires would be placed there, so as
    to give a great display without the expense of a building.</p>

  <p>Evelyn, the famous diarist, gives an account of one such
    display which he witnessed in 1664.</p>

  <p>In other towns that wished to imitate the festival of
    Rome, it was arranged to place illuminations on the highest
    towers and steeples of the towns, but as it was found that
    there was considerable danger of fire from these, it was afterwards
    preferred to make suitable erections in the great public
    squares, which were convenient for the exhibition itself and
    also for the sightseers.</p>

  <p>The Italians appear to have held the supremacy until the
    end of the seventeenth century.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

  <p>In the book of Artillery by Diego Ufano, written in 1610,
    we read that only very simple fireworks were made in his
    time in Spain and Flanders, consisting of wooden framework
    supporting pots of fire wrapped round with cloth dipped in
    pitch, but that more than fifty years before magnificent
    spectacles could be seen in Italy.</p>

  <p>In 1615, on the occasion of the marriage of Louis <abbr title="the thirteenth">XIII</abbr>,
    a display was given at Paris in the Place Royale, in which
    were included combats between men carrying illuminated arms.</p>

  <p>In 1606 the Duc de Sully gave a spectacle which depicted
    a battle between savages and monsters, the former throwing
    darts and fire. A similar display had previously been given
    on the occasion of the entry of Henry <abbr title="the second">II</abbr> into Rheims, and it
    was repeated in 1612.</p>

  <p>These spectacles, which are quoted as firework displays,
    cannot rightly be considered as such, fireworks playing a
    comparatively secondary part in the exhibitions.</p>

  <p>A display of this nature to celebrate the capture of Rochelle
    was conducted by Clariner of Nuremberg, a celebrated pyrotechnist
    of the day.</p>

  <p>During the reign of Louis <abbr title="the fourteenth">XIV</abbr>, 1638–1715, great advances
    were made in pyrotechny in France; great displays were
    given on the return of the King and Queen to Paris in 1660,
    on five consecutive days at Versailles in 1676, also on the
    occasion of the birth of the Dauphin in 1682, in Paris at the
    Louvre, Dijon, and Lyons.</p>

  <p>A particularly fine display in celebration of the Peace of
    Riswick, 1669 (for which event displays took place in several
    countries), is mentioned by Frézier, who wrote a treatise on
    pyrotechny (1747); it was, he says, witnessing this display
    that inspired him to study the art.</p>

    <div class="caption">Set Piece of the Scenic Type.</div>
  </div>

  <p>One of the chief causes of progress in France was the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>encouragement given by Louis <abbr title="the fifteenth">XV</abbr> (1710–1774) to the pyrotechnists
    Morel Torré and the Ruggieri brothers, the latter
    being Italians from Bologna who became naturalised Frenchmen,
    and contributed very greatly to the development of
    French pyrotechny. They were the first to rely chiefly on
    fireworks for the effect, instead of using them merely to
    embellish a scenic or architectural structure.</p>

  <p>Louis <abbr title="the fifteenth">XV</abbr> expended large sums of money on displays,
    one of the finest being that fired at Versailles in 1739 by
    Ruggieri, on the occasion of the marriage of Madame La
    Première of France with Don Philippe of Spain. Writing of
    this display in 1821, Ruggieri&rsquo;s son says: &ldquo;There appeared
    for the first time the <span lang="fr">Salamander la Rosace</span> and <span lang="fr">le Guilloche</span>,
    which are still admired to-day.&rdquo; These are purely pyrotechnic
    pieces and devices; similar or identical ones are used at the
    present day, which seems to indicate that fireworks proper
    were making headway against scenic effect.</p>

  <p>Other displays in France during the eighteenth century
    were those on the occasions of the birth of the Duke of
    Brittany, 1704; birth of the Dauphin, 1730; the convalescence
    of the King, 1744; and the return of the King to Paris, 1745.
    Also there is in existence a series of prints which, but for the
    fact that they are described as fireworks, would be taken to
    be scenic tableaux; whether the figures are human beings or
    wax-works is not indicated. These were erected in celebration
    of the following events:&mdash;The taking of Tournay, the taking
    of Chateau Grand, Victory over the Allies, all dated 1745;
    the taking of Ypres, 1747, all of which took place in Paris
    before the Hotel de Ville. Similar displays were given in
    Lyons in 1765 to celebrate the taking of Fort San Philippe,
    and at Soleure in 1777, in honour of the Swiss Guard.</p>

  <p>Displays took place at Versailles (1751) on the occasion of
    the birth of the Duke of Burgundy. In 1758–9 came a further
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>series of victory celebrations in honour of the victory of
    Lutzelberg, over the English in America, and over the Allies
    at Bergheri, all of which appear to have been of the &ldquo;tableau&rdquo;
    type mentioned above.</p>

  <p>There were also displays for the peace celebrations on
    the Seine, 1763, the birth of the Dauphin, 1782, in the Place
    de Geneve, and peace rejoicings, 1783, before the Hotel de
    Ville.</p>

  <p>Ruggieri, however, states in his book that the display
    fired on the marriage of Louis <abbr title="the sixteenth">XVI</abbr> (or, as he then was, the
    Dauphin) was the only display since the great fetes of 1739
    which showed any considerable advance in the art; he may,
    however, be in some degree biased as his father was concerned
    in each of these displays.</p>

      PYROTECHNY IN EUROPE (<i>continued</i>)</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">During</span> the later part of the seventeenth century,
    and subsequently, many prints appeared depicting
    firework displays; their number seems quite out of
    proportion to the total number of prints published in that
    period.</p>

  <p>Possibly this may be taken as some indication of the
    popularity of firework displays at the time, or may give the
    measure of the favour in which they were held by the artists
    of the day.</p>

  <p>Many of these prints are of little value to the student of
    pyrotechny, as they merely depict the more or less elaborate
    structure for the display by daylight, and whatever may be
    their architectural or artistic merit there is generally no indication
    of what actual fireworks were to be used, or how they
    were to be displayed.</p>

  <p>In some cases a list of the works is given under the engraving,
    adding greatly to its value in the eyes of the pyrotechnist,
    and some, although they are considerably in the
    minority, are intended to represent the display in progress,
    although on the rather futuristic method of showing everything
    going off at one time.</p>

  <p>A series of prints published in Germany during the seventeenth
    century are among the earliest in which a serious
    attempt is made to depict pyrotechnic effects; the series
    includes &ldquo;Swedish Fireworks,&rdquo; dated 1650; &ldquo;Fireworks
    at Nuremburg in celebration of Peace,&rdquo; of the same date;
    &ldquo;Fireworks given at Pleissenburg by the Prince of Saxony,&rdquo;
    1666; and the same year, &ldquo;Fireworks at Vienna&rdquo;; all three
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>prints show a good display of rockets, also bonfires, and there
    are indications of primitive wheels. The same remarks apply
    to a very fine plate published in 1669, depicting a display
    given at Stockholm in honour of the investiture of Charles <abbr title="the eleventh">XI</abbr>
    of Sweden with the Order of the Garter by the British
    Ambassador. This engraving carries with it a feeling of conviction
    that it is an actual representation of the scene, and
    not&mdash;as is the case with earlier and with some later work&mdash;that
    the artist is drawing on his imagination. In many of the
    earlier prints it is difficult to judge if the artist is depicting
    what he imagined, or monsters and scenic effects actually
    constructed for the display.</p>

  <p>It is worthy of note that even in early times, speaking
    pyrotechnically, the value of water in enhancing the effect
    of fireworks seems to have been realised. The display at
    Stockholm we have already mentioned appears to have taken
    place on the sea front. Many of the larger French displays of
    the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were fired with a
    foreground of water; in those at Versailles full advantage
    was taken of the wonderful fountains and ornamental
    water, the display given in celebration of the entry of Louis
    <abbr title="the fourteenth">XIV</abbr> in Paris after his marriage being given on the Seine, and
    many of the early English displays took place on the Thames.
    Probably the earliest contemporary account of any length of
    a firework display in England is one headed &ldquo;The Manner of
    Fire-Workes shewed up upon the Thames&rdquo; in celebration
    of the marriage of Prince Frederick (Elector Palatine) with
    the daughter of James <abbr title="the first">I</abbr> in 1613. We read &ldquo;many artificiall
    concusions in Fire-Workes were upon the Thames performed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;First, for a welcome to the beholders a peale of Ordnance
    like unto a terrible thunder ratled in the ayre.... Secondly,
    followed a number more of the same fashion, spredding
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>so strangely with sparkling blazes, that the skie seemed to be
    filled with fire.... After this, in a most curious manner,
    an artificiall fire-worke with great wonder was seen flying in
    the ayre, like unto a fiery Dragon, against which another
    fierrie vision appeared flaming like to Saint George on Horsebacke,
    brought in by a burning Inchanter, between which
    was then fought a most strange battell continuing a quarter
    of an howre or more; the dragon being vanquished, seemed
    to roar like thunder, and withall burst in pieces, and so
    vanished; but the champion, with his flaming horse, for a
    little time made a shew of a tryumphant conquest, and so
    ceased.</p>

    <div class="caption">Great Firework Display near Stockholm, July, 1669. To celebrate the Investiture of
      Charles <abbr title="the eleventh">XI</abbr>, King of Sweden,
      with the Order of the Garter by King Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>.</div>
  </div>

    <p>&ldquo;After this was heard another ratling sound of Cannons,
    almost covering the ayre with fire and smoke, and forthwith
    appeared, out of a hill of earth made upon the water, a very
    strange fire, flaming upright like unto a blazing starre. After
    which flew forth a number of rockets so high in the ayre, that
    we could not chose but approve by all reasons that Arte hath
    exceeded Nature, so artificially were they performed. And
    still as the Chambers and Culverines plaide upon the earth,
    the fire-workes danced in the ayre, to the great delight of his
    Highnes and the Princes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Out of the same mount or hill of earth flew another
    strange piece of artificiall fire-worke, which was in the likenes
    of a hunted Harte, running upon the water so swiftly, as
    it had been chaced by many huntsmen.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;After the same, issued out of the mount a number of
    hunting-hounds made of fire burning, pursuing the aforesaid
    Harte up and downe the waters, making many rebounds
    and turnes with much strangenes; skipping in the ayre as it
    had been a usual hunting upon land.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;These were the noble delights of Princes, and prompt
    were the wits of men to contrive such princely pleasures.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>Where Kings commands be, Art is stretcht to the true depth;
    as the performance of these Engineers have been approved.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But now again to our wished sports: when this fiery
    hunting was extinguished, and that the Elements were a little
    cleared from fire and smoke, there came sailing up, as it were
    upon the Seas, certaine ships and gallies bravely rigged with
    top and top gallant, with their flagges and streamers waving
    like Men of Warr, which represented a Christian name
    opposed against the Turkes; where, after they had awhile
    hovered, preparing as it were, to make an incursion into the
    Turkish country, they were discovered by her Towers or
    Castles of defence, strongly furnished to intercept all such
    invading purposes, so sending forth the reports of a cannon,
    they were bravely answered with the like from the gallies,
    banding fire and powder one from another, as if the God of
    Battle had been there present.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here was the manner of a sea-fight rightly performed:
    First, by assailing one another, all striving for victorie, and
    pursuing each other with fire and sword: the Culverines
    merrily plaid betwixt them, and made the ayre resound with
    thundering echoes; and at last to represent the joyes of a
    victorie, the Castles were sacked, burned, and ruinated, and
    the defenders of the same forced to escape with great danger.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The foregoing appears to be the only full account of a
    display in England during the early part of the seventeenth
    century, but in the first serious work on fireworks, &ldquo;Pyrotechnia,&rdquo;
    by John Babington, &ldquo;gunner and student of the
    mathematicks,&rdquo; we find a proposed programme for &ldquo;a generall
    piece of fire-worke for land, for the pleasure of a Prince or
    some great person.&rdquo; The spectacle consists of two castles
    with mechanical effects, but includes such devices as horizontal
    and vertical wheels, flights of rockets, line rockets and
    &ldquo;torches of beautifull fire.&rdquo; Babington also describes the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George and Dragon device, which is merely scenic, the
    figures being of wickerwork and canvas with slight firework
    effects. At this time, according to a &ldquo;History of Colleges in
    and arround London,&rdquo; there were &ldquo;many men very skilful
    in the art of pyrotechny and fireworks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In a book on fireworks, published in the same year, by
    John Bate, the author concludes by saying: &ldquo;I might have
    been infinite in the describing of such like with Ships, Towers,
    Castles, Pyramides. But, considering that it would but increase
    the price of the book and not better your understanding,
    since all consist of the former workes, which are so
    plainly described as that the most ignorant may easily conceive
    thereof, and (if any whit ingenious) thence contrive
    others, of what fashion they list.&rdquo; From this it would appear
    that firework displays were by that date a well-established
    institution.</p>

  <p>Pepys, in his account of the coronation of Charles <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>,
    1661, says: &ldquo;We staid upon the leads and below till it was
    late, expecting to see the fireworks, but they were not performed
    to-night.&rdquo; He seems to have looked upon fireworks
    as a matter of course on such an occasion. However, a display
    of considerable size did take place, conducted by Sir Martin
    Beckman, later Firemaster to James <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>, who was responsible
    for most of the important displays until 1706. One of the
    earliest prints of an English firework display is that depicting
    the fireworks on the Thames at Whitehall for the coronation
    of James <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>, 1685, in which the artist appears to have drawn
    somewhat on his imagination.</p>

  <p>Three years later an elaborate display was given on the
    Thames to celebrate the birth of an heir to the throne, who
    was afterwards known as the Old Pretender. In the same year
    we again see fireworks on the Thames, this time to celebrate
    the reception of the Prince of Orange.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span></p>

  <p>In 1690 displays were given, again on the Thames, and
    in Covent Garden, on the occasion of the King&rsquo;s return from
    Ireland.</p>

  <p>The taking of Namur, 1695, was celebrated by a display
    in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James&rsquo;s Square, and on the same site two years later,
    the celebrations for the Peace of Riswick. This latter is
    depicted in a fine engraving, giving the following list of fireworks
    used on the occasion:&mdash;&ldquo;1,000 Sky Rockets, from four
    to six pounds weight; 200 Shell; 2,400 Pumps with Starrs
    (Roman Candles); 1,000 Cones; 7,000 Reports; 15,000
    Swarms; 400 Light Balls; 23 Rocket Chests, each containing
    60 rockets from one to four pounders.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>John Evelyn, in his &ldquo;Diary,&rdquo; says: &ldquo;The evening concluded
    with illuminations and fireworks of great expense.&rdquo;
    The display cost £12,000.</p>

  <p>There seem to have been no fireworks in London at the
    coronation of either Anne or the first two Georges, although
    on the former occasion rockets appear to have been fired from
    the Fleet at Spithead.</p>

  <p>The Peace Rejoicings of 1713 were the occasion of
    another display on the Thames off Whitehall, the erection
    being about 400 feet long on barges chained together in the
    stream. A feature of this display was the water fireworks,
    described as: &ldquo;1,500 small and large water Rockets; 5 large
    water Pyramids; 4 water fountains; 13 Pumps; 21 standing
    Rockets, with lights all swimming on the water; 84 of
    Coll Borgards; large and small Bees swarms, half of which
    were set with lights to swim on the water.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The next event to be celebrated by firework displays on a
    large scale was the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle; these were given
    at Paris, The Hague, London, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen&rsquo;s Green,
    Dublin. The Duke of Richmond was responsible for a display
    on the Thames off Whitehall, the official display taking
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>place in Green Park, and was on a scale unequalled in this
    country until well into the last century. It was conducted by
    the famous pyrotechnist Gaetano Ruggieri, who came over
    from France for the purpose, assisted by Gioseppe Sarti,
    under the direction of the Board of Ordnance.</p>

    <div class="caption">Fireworks on the Thames, June 17th, 1688. To celebrate the birth of a son to King James <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr> known to fame
      first as the Prince of Wales, and afterwards as the Old Pretender.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Following the practice of the period, an elaborate structure
    was prepared. The following is taken from the official programme:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="center">&ldquo;A DESCRIPTION OF THE MACHINE FOR THE
      FIREWORKS, &amp;c.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The Machine is 114 feet high to the Top of His
      Majesty&rsquo;s arms, and is 410 feet long. It was invented and
      designed by the Chevalier Servandoni and all the framing
      was performed by Mr. James Morris, Master Carpenter
      to the Office of Ordnance.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The Ornaments of this Machine are all in Relief, and
      it is adorned with Frets, Gilding, Lustres, Artificial Flowers,
      Inscriptions, Statues, Allegorical Pictures, etc.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>According to a contemporary newspaper report, the construction
    occupied from November 7th until April 26th. It
    was composed of timber covered with canvas, whitewashed
    and sized.</p>

  <p>The display commenced about six o&rsquo;clock, and continued
    until after twelve; during the display the left wing caught fire,
    which prevented the firing of some of the devices. Indeed,
    according to Walpole, the Duke of Richmond&rsquo;s display on
    the Thames a few weeks later consisted largely of fireworks
    which had not been fired owing to this occurrence, and which
    the noble duke had bought up cheap.</p>

  <p>Among the items were included the following:&mdash;Regulated
    Pieces, Fixed Suns, Stars of six Points, and between
    each point a Ray, a large vertical Sun moved by double Fires,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>Cascades, Pyramids (40 feet high) of Gerbs, etc., etc. The
    chief piece seems to be one &ldquo;from whence Fire issues out and
    retires within, twelve times alternately; when without, it
    forms a Glory; when within, it composes a Star of eight
    Points, and then changes to a Royal brilliant Wheel, whose
    Fire is thirty feet in diameter, and is moved by twelve fires.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The remainder of this century in England appears to be
    rather barren of firework displays on a large scale.</p>

  <p>A writer in the &ldquo;<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James&rsquo;s Chronicle,&rdquo; under the date
    February 18th, 1764, in a letter advocating certain improvements
    in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James&rsquo;s Park, evidently recalling the outcry over
    the 1749 display, observes: &ldquo;We had no fireworks at the
    peace last year, that will surely obviate any argument preferred
    against the expense of the undertaking.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Until nearly the end of the eighteenth century, according
    to Strutt, writing at that time, it was customary &ldquo;for the
    Train of Artillery to display a grand fire-work on Tower
    Hill, on the King&rsquo;s Birthday, but owing to the disturbances
    that occurred, the inhabitants a few years since petitioned
    against it.&rdquo; There was, however, a great increase in the number
    of displays. Fireworks became a feature of the programme of
    the majority of the then fashionable tea and pleasure gardens.</p>

  <p>Walpole describes a firework display given in 1763 by the
    notorious Duchess of Kingston, who was thirteen years later
    tried by her peers on a charge of bigamy.</p>

  <p>The display appears to have taken place in Hyde Park,
    opposite the residence of the Duchess, then at the height of
    her popularity. He records that &ldquo;the fireworks were fine
    and succeeded well.&rdquo; One item seems curious to modern
    ideas; it took the form of a cenotaph for the Princess Elizabeth,
    a sister of the king, bearing the inscription: &ldquo;All
    honours the dead can receive.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The sequel was even more extraordinary, as &ldquo;about one
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>in the morning this Sarcophagus burst into crackers and
    guns.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Jones, who published a book on fireworks in
    1765, in his preface makes the following remarks:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I own I cannot help reflecting with some kind of chagrin
    that whenever we have had occasion for these sort of diversions
    to be exhibited in England we have almost always had
    recourse to foreigners to execute them; if this has been owing
    to the ignorance of our own people on this subject I shall be
    very happy if it is in my power to correct it; if it is only owing
    to that prevailing fondness we entertain for everything foreign
    I know no remedy for that evil but time and experience.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>To a certain extent his complaint seems justified; as we
    have seen, the Aix-la-Chapelle celebrations were conducted
    by foreigners&mdash;Ruggieri and Sarti. Later in the century, Morel
    Torré, who, as previously mentioned, collaborated with
    Ruggieri in pyrotechnic displays for Louis <abbr title="the fifteenth">XV</abbr>, and several
    other pyrotechnists came to this country and conducted displays.
    At the same time, however, there were undoubtedly
    many capable pyrotechnists of English nationality, who found
    scope for their abilities in the exhibitions given in the pleasure
    gardens of London and the provinces in the eighteenth and
    early nineteenth centuries.</p>

  <p>A history of pyrotechny would not be complete without
    a survey of these popular places of amusement, and we propose
    in the following chapter to give a brief summary of the
    better known places of resort.</p>

      THE LONDON PLEASURE GARDENS</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">During</span> the eighteenth and first half of the nineteenth
    centuries the Pleasure Gardens filled a position
    in the lives of a large proportion of the public comparable
    with that of the Cinema to-day.</p>

  <p>To the great mass of the public, the most general form of
    evening relaxation was a visit to one or other of these places
    of resort. Apart from meals of a more or less elaborate nature,
    and liquid refreshments of various kinds, a great variety of
    entertainments were provided, varying from displays of horsemanship
    to exhibitions of paintings. Of these diversions none
    were more general than fireworks and illuminations. At many
    gardens fireworks formed a regular feature of the programme,
    at others, generally less ambitious undertakings, displays were
    confined to occasions, such as the King&rsquo;s Birthday.</p>

  <p>Space will hardly permit of more than a glance at those
    resorts situated in the provinces, but a description of those
    in the London area may be taken as typical.</p>

  <p>Captain Marryat, in &ldquo;Peter Simple,&rdquo; gives an account of
    a visit to Postdown Fair, near Portsmouth, and an adjournment
    to the local Ranelagh Gardens to &ldquo;see the fireworks.&rdquo;
    As the pyrotechnist was behind time, Peter Simple and his
    friends took it upon themselves to fire the display. &ldquo;In about
    half a minute off they all went in the most beautiful confusion;
    there were silver stars and golden stars, blue lights
    and Catherine Wheels, Mines and Bombs, Grecian fires and
    Roman Candles, Chinese Trees, rockets and illuminated
    mottoes, all firing away, cracking, popping, and fizzing at
    the same time. It was unanimously agreed that it was a great
    improvement on the intended show.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>
  <p>Undoubtedly the gardens best remembered at the present
    day are Vauxhall and Ranelagh, neither of which were early
    in the field in presenting firework displays to the public.</p>

  <p>The first displays took place at Vauxhall about 1798,
    more than half a century after their appearance at some of
    the less famous gardens, and did not become a permanent
    feature of the programme until 1813. They continued regularly
    until the final closing of the gardens in 1859, the final
    item of the programme being &ldquo;Farewell for Ever&rdquo; in letters
    of fire. In 1813 an item in the firework programme was the
    performance of Madame Saqui, which was to slide down an
    inclined rope 350 feet long from the top of a mast 60 feet
    high, erected on the firework platform, enveloped in fireworks.
    So popular did this exhibition become that it was
    repeated here by other performers, by Longueman in 1822,
    and later by Blackmore.</p>

  <p>The best-known pyrotechnists connected with Vauxhall
    were Southby, Mortram, and Hengler, the first display being
    by an Italian named Invetto.</p>

  <p>Pyrotechnic displays at Ranelagh became a prominent
    feature of the amusements about 1767. The pyrotechnists
    Angelo, father and son, during that and the following years,
    helped to establish these displays in popularity, followed by
    Clithero, Caillot, Brock, Rossi, and Tessier, up to the closing
    of the gardens in 1805, after which date they appear to have
    been opened from time to time on special occasions. &ldquo;The
    Morning Chronicle&rdquo; of June 1st, 1812, announces that &ldquo;By
    the Authority of the Right Hon. the Lord Chamberlain&rdquo;
    these gardens would be open &ldquo;in Honour of His Majesty&rsquo;s
    Birthday, with a grand naval and military Fete, and a superb
    exhibition of Fireworks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>An interesting old advertisement, dated 1766: &ldquo;For the
    Benefit of the General Lying-in Hospital. The most superb
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>and Magnificent Fireworks ever exhibited at that Place, under
    the conduct and direction of Mr. Angelo.&rdquo; It would appear
    from this that fireworks had been fired at Ranelagh earlier than
    1766, but they could not have been a regular feature before 1767.</p>

  <p>Cupers Gardens, which stood on the south side of the
    river, approximately on the site of the Waterloo Bridge
    approach, were for a long period the scene of popular firework
    displays. Commencing about 1741, these displays were as
    elaborate as any of this period. The earlier displays appear to
    have been conducted by &ldquo;the ingenious Mr. Worman,&rdquo; who
    seems to have relied to a considerable extent on transparencies
    and scenery; in 1749 and 1750 he reproduced in miniature
    the firework &ldquo;machine&rdquo; or Temple used in the respective
    official displays in Green Park, and at The Hague for the Aix-la-Chapelle
    peace celebrations. Other scenic effects were a
    view of the city of Rhodes with a model of the Colossus;
    Neptune, issuing from a grotto below drawn by sea-horses,
    set fire to a pyramid or an &ldquo;Archimedan worm&rdquo; and returned.</p>

  <p>Clithero was also associated with these displays, producing
    similar scenic effects, including a naval engagement
    in 1755, which was the last year of fireworks in these gardens.</p>

  <p>The earlier displays at Marylebone Gardens took place
    about the middle of the eighteenth century. In 1751 a display
    is announced to take place at eleven o&rsquo;clock, and &ldquo;a large
    collection&rdquo; of fireworks was advertised in 1753. Some at
    least of these earlier displays were fired by Brock, whose son,
    later on, worked here in conjunction with Torré. In 1769 the
    displays were under the direction of Rossi and Clanfield.
    From 1772 to 1774 was the most successful period of the
    fireworks at these gardens; they were then under the direction
    of Torré. A popular item, afterwards copied by Marinari
    at Ranelagh, was the &ldquo;Forge of Vulcan,&rdquo; a scenic display
    concluding with the eruption of Mount Etna.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>

  <p>On the occasion of Torré&rsquo;s benefit, in 1772, there was a
    further exhibition of this kind, representing Hercules delivering
    Theseus from Hell.</p>

  <p>During this period attempts were made by neighbouring
    residents to stop the displays as a nuisance, but nothing came
    of it, and the fireworks continued.</p>

  <p>At the annual festival in 1772, the display included a
    temple of &ldquo;upwards of 10,000 cases of different fires, all
    lighted at the same time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Other pyrotechnists firing at the gardens were Clithero
    and Caillot, both of whom had conducted displays at Ranelagh,
    the latter being responsible for the fireworks up to the
    closing of the gardens about 1778.</p>

  <p>It is recorded that Dr. Johnson once visited the gardens
    on a firework night, but unfortunately a wet one, and notice
    was given to the handful of visitors that the fireworks were
    wet and the display would be cancelled. The doctor, however,
    was of opinion that it was a &ldquo;mere excuse to save their crackers
    for a more profitable company,&rdquo; and suggested that a threat
    to break the lamps would result in the show being forthcoming.
    Some young men standing by endeavoured, under
    his direction, to ignite the pieces, but unsuccessfully.</p>

  <p>The Mulberry Gardens, Clerkenwell, were among the
    earliest to make fireworks a feature. Displays took place from
    the opening in 1742, and ten years later Clanfield gave a display
    each evening.</p>

  <p>Two neighbouring taverns, &ldquo;Lord Cobham&rsquo;s Head&rdquo;
    and the &ldquo;Sir John Oldcastle,&rdquo; had displays from 1744, and
    in 1751 &ldquo;New fireworks in the Chinese manner&rdquo; were
    announced at the latter establishment.</p>

  <p>The New Wells, in the same neighbourhood as the foregoing,
    had had a display as early as 1740, but it appears to have
    been of a scenic nature, representing the Siege of Portobello.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

  <p>The &ldquo;Star and Garter,&rdquo; Chelsea, advertised displays by
    Signor Genovini of Rome, in 1762, and &ldquo;Jenny&rsquo;s Whim,&rdquo;
    in the same neighbourhood, had displays somewhat earlier,
    the place having been established as a pleasure resort by a
    pyrotechnist.</p>

  <p>Cromwell Gardens, in the vicinity of the present Cromwell
    Road, had what appears to have been a small display in 1784.</p>

  <p>Rossi and Tessier, the pyrotechnists of Ranelagh, gave
    displays at the Bermondsey Spa Gardens in 1792. A representation
    of the Siege of Gibraltar was given, and on September
    28th of that year, &ldquo;by special desire the Battle of the Fiery
    Dragons, and the line comet to come from the Rock of Gibraltar
    and cause the Dragons to engage.&rdquo; Brock also gave
    displays here later.</p>

  <p>Finch&rsquo;s Grotto Gardens, whose site is now occupied by
    the headquarters of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade in Southwark,
    had occasional displays of fireworks about 1770, as did
    the Temple of Flora in the Westminster Bridge Road, about
    the same date. Clithero advertised a display of fireworks at
    Jamaica House, Rotherhithe, in 1762.</p>

  <p>A Peace Celebration display is announced for February
    7th, 1749, to &ldquo;be play&rsquo;d off this evening in the Field adjoining
    to the Tavern called Bob&rsquo;s Hall.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In 1788 Astley senior advertises, to take place at the
    Royal Grove and Astley&rsquo;s Amphitheatre, Westminster Bridge,
    a &ldquo;Double Display of Fire-Works.... Numerous Devices
    prepared in the usual way from Powder, etc., which will be
    alternatively played off with the new-invented Philosophical
    Fire-Works, under the direction of Mons. Henry, the inventor
    and Professor of Natural Philosophy from Paris.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The same year he announces a display &ldquo;on the Thames
    immediately after Astley&rsquo;s Exhibition in Honour of His
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>Majesty&rsquo;s Birth-day,&rdquo; and concludes by saying &ldquo;the Fireworks
    are made under the Direction of Mr. Astley, by Messrs.
    Cobonell &amp; Son, who will let them off on the Thames this
    evening at different signals from Mr. Astley, Sen., who will
    be mounted on the Gibraltar Charger, placed in a Barge, in
    the Front of the line of Fireworks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The &ldquo;Philosophical fireworks&rdquo; above mentioned were
    evidently an imitation of those exhibited at the Lyceum by
    Diller, which he describes as &ldquo;Philosophical Fireworks from
    Inflammable Air without smell, smoke or Detonation.&rdquo; These
    appear to have been nothing more than gas jets arranged in
    patterns and designs, some revolving and some stationary.
    Air was forced from a bladder through a sponge saturated
    with ether. Movement and variation were produced by
    turning on and off the gas from separate sets of holes. Two
    colours only appear to have been produced&mdash;rose and green;
    these were by the addition of strontia and baryta or
    copper.</p>

  <p>A handbill is in existence advertising a similar display at
    Hull in 1804, by W. Clarke.</p>

  <p>During the early part of the nineteenth century several
    gardens round London made a feature of pyrotechnic displays.
    The Mermaid Gardens, Hackney, in &ldquo;The Morning
    Chronicle&rdquo; of June 1st, 1812, announces &ldquo;the greatest feast
    for the eye ever exhibited is a superb firework by that unparalleled
    artist, Mr. Brock, Engineer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Yorkshire Stingo and Bayswater Tea Gardens in the
    west gave displays up to the early forties. White Conduit
    House, in the Islington district, had firework displays from
    1824 up to shortly before the closing of these gardens in 1849.</p>

  <p>Rosherville Gardens, opened in 1837, the North Woolwich
    Gardens, the Eagle, 1825–82, the Globe, Mile End, the
    Cremorne, 1843–77, all had their firework displays. The best
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>known, however, for this feature were the Surrey Zoological
    Gardens, 1831–56, where Southby, of Vauxhall, conducted
    displays for several years, producing pyrotechnic and scenic
    displays there. In 1841 he gave a reproduction of the fireworks
    of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Angelo, and the Illumination of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter&rsquo;s,
    Rome, which proved a great attraction to the gardens.</p>

  <p>In the provinces the Belvue Gardens, Manchester, and
    the Clifton Zoological Gardens, Bristol, have made a feature
    of firework displays in their list of attractions, those at the
    latter being carried out in 1835 by Gyngell.</p>

  <p>The famous Cremorne Gardens made a feature of pyrotechnic
    displays and spectacles of the scenic type with more
    or less regularity from their opening in 1846 down to the final
    closing owing to public petition in 1877. The earlier displays
    were carried out by Mortram and Duffel.</p>

  <p>Firework displays of a somewhat more ambitious nature
    have been given from time to time at the Alexandra Palace,
    no doubt in emulation of the historic Crystal Palace displays,
    which are dealt with in the ensuing chapter.</p>

      FIREWORKS IN THE NINETEENTH &amp; TWENTIETH CENTURIES</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">As</span> we have seen, the commencement of the eighteenth
    century was marked by great activity in the
    pyrotechnic art.</p>

  <p>Firework displays were looked upon as a necessary item
    in the programme of a place of public entertainment. So
    ambitious did these displays become, owing to keen rivalry
    existing between the various resorts, that any official display
    in celebration of peace or like event must of necessity be on a
    scale of unexampled lavishness.</p>

  <p>No official display of note appears to have been given in
    London during the first thirteen years of the nineteenth
    century, or indeed since the Aix-la-Chapelle peace display.
    The reason may have been the public outcry on the score of
    waste on that occasion.</p>

  <p>They were totally prohibited at the coronation of George
    <abbr title="the third">III</abbr>, and at his jubilee in 1809 there were apparently no
    firework displays in London, although more than forty towns
    about the country celebrated the event pyrotechnically, and
    a fine display was given from the Fleet at the Nore.</p>

  <p>The largest public firework exhibition on this occasion
    was that given at Bombay, where the celebration took place
    earlier in the year, the date selected being June 4th, the King&rsquo;s
    birthday, instead of October 25th, the actual anniversary of
    his accession.</p>

  <p>The Peace of 1802, although no official display was given,
    was the occasion of much private pyrotechnic enterprise, the
    fireworks and illuminations in London lasting nearly a week.</p>
  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>
  <p>The Peace of 1814 was signalised in London by several
    displays: the 1st of August was chosen for the Peace Celebration,
    it being the centenary of the accession of the House
    of Brunswick, and also the anniversary of the Battle of the
    Nile.</p>

  <p>The display in Hyde Park commenced with a naval engagement
    on the Serpentine between model warships representing
    the English and the combined French and American
    Fleets. This item, which lasted three hours, was followed by
    a display of water fireworks. The display in Green Park
    commenced at ten o&rsquo;clock, one of the chief items being the
    &ldquo;grand metamorphosis of the Castle into the Temple of
    Concord.&rdquo; This change, says a writer in &ldquo;The Times&rdquo; of the
    period, &ldquo;was made with somewhat less celerity than those
    witnessed in our theatrical pantomimes. It resembled rather
    the cautious removal of a screen than the sudden leap into a
    new shape. When fully developed, however, it presented a
    spectacle which excited general approbation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Temple of Concord was an elaborate structure
    illuminated with coloured lamps, and decorated with gilding,
    festoons, etc., and transparent paintings. It was designed by
    Smirke, the paintings being by Stodard, Howard, Hilton,
    and others, and represented such subjects as &ldquo;The Golden
    Age,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Peace restored to Earth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Charles Lamb, in a letter to William Wordsworth, dated
    August 9th, 1814, after describing the havoc wrought in the
    park by the crowds and booths, remarks that: &ldquo;After all
    the fireworks were splendent&mdash;the Rockets in clusters, in
    trees and all shapes, spreading about like young stars in the
    making floundering about in space (like unbroke horses) till
    some of Newton&rsquo;s calculations should fix them, but then they
    went out. Anyone who could see &rsquo;em and the still finer
    showers of gloomy rain fire that fell sulkily and angrily from
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>&rsquo;em, and could go to bed without dreaming of the Last Day,
    must be as hardened an Atheist as ****.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James&rsquo;s Park was reserved for those who paid for
    admission. The trees were illuminated with lamps, and a
    Chinese bridge, which had been erected over the lake, was
    similarly treated. The use of gas on this structure must be
    one of the earliest occasions of its being employed for outdoor
    illuminations of this nature. Neither can the result be
    considered altogether successful, as the building caught fire
    towards the end of the firework display, and a lamplighter,
    who appears to have been caught by the flames in an attempt
    to throw himself into the water, was killed. Other men similarly
    employed were also severely burned. These men, evidently
    through ignorance, had started lighting the lower lamps first,
    working upwards on the structure, until they found themselves
    in a position of intolerable heat with no means of
    descending.</p>

  <p>The pyrotechnic display consisted chiefly of aerial fireworks
    with gerbs, roman candles, fountains, and wheels;
    there do not appear to have been many devices of any size.
    &ldquo;The Times&rdquo; reporter complains that &ldquo;the repetition of these
    things, with occasional pauses, for more than two hours became
    tedious to all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The coronation of George <abbr title="the fourth">IV</abbr>, in 1821, was celebrated
    by a display in Hyde Park, including land and water fireworks,
    superintended by Congreve. The displays on the
    coronation of William <abbr title="the fourth">IV</abbr>, in 1831, were directed by Congreve&rsquo;s
    successor, Sir Augustus Frazer, but appear to have
    been of an insignificant character.</p>

  <p>Queen Victoria&rsquo;s coronation was celebrated by displays
    in Hyde Park and Green Park, conducted by Southby and
    D&rsquo;Ernst, which exhibitions included a Temple on similar
    lines to that of 1814.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

  <p>In France, during the first few years of the nineteenth
    century, there were many pyrotechnic displays of importance.
    Napoleon is credited with being extremely partial to such
    exhibitions. Displays took place in Paris in the <span lang="fr">Champs
    Elysées</span>, at the <span lang="fr">barriere Chaillot</span>, before <span lang="fr">Les Invalides</span> in 1801
    to celebrate the foundation of the Republic, and in the following
    year in honour of Napoleon&rsquo;s arrival in that city.</p>

  <p>Major-General Lord Blayney, who was captured by
    Napoleon&rsquo;s troops in the Peninsula in 1810, travelled on
    parole across Spain and France on his way to Verdun. His
    somewhat leisurely journey of nearly six months enabled
    him to witness many celebrations of French victories in the
    towns through which he passed. He records having seen
    fireworks and illuminations among other places at Malaga
    and Orleans.</p>

  <p>In 1804 a display was given by Napoleon before the Hotel
    de Ville, Paris, on his assumption of the title of Emperor of
    the French. The scenery provided for this display took the
    form of a representation of Mount <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bernard, with a figure
    symbolising Napoleon mounted on a charger on the summit.</p>

  <p>This display was repeated in 1810 on the occasion of his
    marriage with Marie Louise; this time, however, the topmost
    feature was the Temple of Hymen, with figures of
    Napoleon and his bride.</p>

  <p>Other displays were given on the bridge of Louis <abbr title="the sixteenth">XVI</abbr>,
    which appears to have been a popular position for such exhibitions,
    in 1800, 1804, 1806, 1820, and 1821. Another site
    frequently used for displays was the garden of the Senate,
    where Ruggieri fired displays in the years 1801, 1806 (twice),
    and 1807.</p>

  <p>Fireworks continued to be a national institution in France,
    irrespective of the form of government. Louis Napoleon, like
    his uncle, being fond of fireworks, or it may be, considering
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>them a good means of gaining popularity, made any public
    event an excuse for pyrotechnic displays. Notable occasions
    were the Military Fetes, 1852, the Fete of the Emperor,
    1853, the visit of Queen Victoria to the Paris Exhibition of
    1855, in honour of which a most elaborate display was given
    at Versailles, the Baptismal Fetes in 1856, the triumphal
    entry and the Emperor&rsquo;s birthday, 1859, and the visit of the
    King Consort of Spain in 1864.</p>

  <p>The Entente Cordiale movement in 1868 was responsible
    for displays in the Fleets on both sides of the Channel, those
    in France taking place in Cherbourg, those in England at
    Spithead.</p>

  <p>A previous event which had been celebrated pyrotechnically
    on a large scale in both countries was the Peace Rejoicing
    at the conclusion of the Crimean War.</p>

  <p>This occasion was marked in London by four displays of
    fireworks on a scale hitherto unprecedented. The sites chosen
    were Hyde Park, Green Park, Primrose Hill, and Victoria
    Park. They were arranged thus with the very sensible idea
    of splitting the crowds of sightseers into sections and thus
    preventing dangerous crowding to one spot. The fireworks
    were prepared for these displays in Woolwich Arsenal, under
    the direction of Mr. Southby, the pyrotechnist of the Surrey
    Gardens, who went there for this event.</p>

  <p>The programmes of these displays were precisely similar,
    with the exception of that at Primrose Hill, which consisted
    mainly of aerial fireworks.</p>

  <p>Tyrrell, in his &ldquo;History of the War with Russia,&rdquo; gives
    the following account of the display in Green Park: &ldquo;At
    the appointed signal there was a continuous discharge of
    maroons, accompanied by brilliant illuminations with white,
    red, green, and yellow fires.... Then for two hours followed
    every conceivable design of elegant and dazzling pyrotechnic
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>art. Flights of rockets a hundred at a time; revolving wheels,
    sun star and golden streamers, and fiery serpents chasing
    each other through the air. Gerbs, Roman candles, tourbillions,
    shells, and fixed pieces of the most fantastic designs and
    brilliant hues. The eyes were dazzled by the intensity of the
    light.... It was strange to believe that so fierce and ungovernable
    an element as fire could be rendered so delicately
    obedient to the will of man.... The triumph, however, of
    the entertainment was reserved for the close of it. This was
    a tremendous bombardment, during which the air was constantly
    filled with flights of rockets, and was intended as a
    representation of the last grand attack upon Sebastopol&mdash;the
    blowing up of the magazines and works, and general conflagration.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As an introduction to this there were five fixed pieces, all
    of complicated construction, the centre being an enormous
    one which, amid all its fantastic blazing and revolving, exhibited
    the words &lsquo;God Save the Queen.&rsquo; Language fails to
    convey a vivid idea of the deafening, roaring, crashing and
    grand appearance of the termination, during which the proud
    fortifications of Sebastopol were supposed to succumb. Then
    rose up into the blackness, rapidly one after another, six
    flights of rockets, comprising altogether no less than ten
    thousand of these beautiful and brilliant instruments.... It
    was such a spectacle as man could not reasonably expect to
    witness more than once in a lifetime.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This account appears to be somewhat highly coloured,
    as the official programme makes no reference to the fall of
    Sebastopol, but it is evident from it that the writer was greatly
    impressed with the display, and contemporary prints indicate
    that he was voicing popular opinion.</p>

  <p>It is worthy of note that these celebrations were the first
    occasion of the kind in which the exhibitions consisted of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>veritable fireworks without extraneous matter in the form of
    scenery and buildings. This may account for the fact that
    there was, on this occasion, considerably less of the usual
    outcry against the &ldquo;waste&rdquo; involved. It is curious that on
    occasions of this kind there are always to be found certain
    damp spirits who begin a clamour against the expenditure of
    money on fireworks which might be applied to other objects.
    The Aix-la-Chapelle display excited these gentlemen to a
    great pitch, probably on account of the elaborate nature of
    the preparations, which, as we have already seen, occupied
    over five months, thus providing them with plenty of time to
    develop their theme, or an object lesson to prove their statements.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Where, however, the display consists&mdash;as on the occasion
    under consideration&mdash;solely of fireworks proper, a few days&rsquo;
    preparation on the actual site is usually sufficient; the kill-joy
    has less time to spread himself. It may be mentioned his
    season is over with the display; generally the British public,
    having enjoyed itself, turns a deaf ear to those who would
    convince it that it ought not to have done so.</p>

  <p>Other displays took place in various parts of the kingdom:
    in Edinburgh on Arthur&rsquo;s Seat, at Portsmouth on the Fleet,
    to mention two only.</p>

  <p>An interesting event which took place on the 25th August
    was the entertainment of 2,000 men of the Guards at the
    Surrey Gardens. This resort was at the time the home of
    British pyrotechny, the displays being conducted by Southby,
    who, as we have said, went into Woolwich Arsenal to assist
    in the production of the fireworks for the official displays.
    The amusements of the day concluded with an exhibition of
    fireworks.</p>

  <p>A further event connected with the foregoing celebration
    was the festivities in Moscow on the occasion of the coronation
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>of the Emperor Alexander <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>, which concluded with a
    pyrotechnic display.</p>

  <p>From this time until the end of the century the history of
    pyrotechny in this country is practically the history of pyrotechny
    at the Crystal Palace; it has been the Crystal Palace
    displays which have set the pace, as it were, to pyrotechnists
    in this country, and has provided the spur which has placed
    British pyrotechnists not only ahead but markedly ahead of
    their competitors in other countries.</p>

  <p>The Crystal Palace displays became a national institution,
    and any public event worthy of such recognition was accorded
    a pyrotechnic celebration there on a scale hitherto unattempted.</p>

  <p>The credit for the original introduction of fireworks at
    the Crystal Palace must belong to the late C. T. Brock, who
    succeeded in inducing the Directors to institute a competition
    among pyrotechnists in 1865. It may be interesting to give in
    his own words an account of the matter, taken from an article
    written by him some few years later:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;It occurred to me that of all the places of public resort
      suitable for the inauguration of a new era for pyrotechny,
      none offered such glorious advantages as the Crystal Palace,
      then at the height of its popularity. Its terraces, fountains
      and foliage offered unrivalled advantages for the display of
      grand effects. The Directors of the Crystal Palace Company,
      who had more than once been applied to for permission
      to hold displays in the grounds, feared that, inasmuch
      as fireworks had been recently associated solely with
      gardens of the Cremorne class, the Palace itself would be
      degraded to the same rank if consent were granted. I urged
      that the Exhibition of 1862 had afforded no opportunity for
      competition among firework makers&mdash;necessarily excluded
      by the nature of their trade&mdash;although almost every other
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>branch of manufactures were embraced, that such a contest
      might with reason and advantage be held at Sydenham, and
      that fireworks were really not of an immoral tendency. I
      further agreed that in the event of the result being unfavourable,
      either financially or from a social point of view, no
      second display need take place, but if, as I felt confident,
      there should be a large attendance of the better classes, then
      other exhibitions might follow. The Directors, after many
      months of delay, consented to make the experiment, and
      the favourable result of the trial on July 12th, 1865, far
      exceeded my most sanguine expectations.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The result was an unlooked-for success, 20,000 people
      being present on the occasion. Three more displays took
      place that year upon a small scale, but always with successful
      results.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The first display was produced jointly by my father and
      Mr. Southby, the winner of the first prize, and continued
      to the end of that season by my father alone under my
      management.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The success of fireworks at the Crystal Palace having
      become an accomplished fact, I built extensive works at
      Nunhead, and commenced manufacturing on a scale never
      previously dreamt of in the trade&mdash;the vast expanse of the
      locale of my displays obviously necessitating extraordinary
      expenditure of material.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;By degrees the set pieces grew from twelve feet in
      diameter to 300 feet. Shells for which the Crystal Palace
      has been renowned grew to one hundred times more than
      the ordinary shells of my early days, and thousands of
      pounds weight of material was gradually introduced to
      increase the effectiveness of these displays.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Crystal Palace displays carried out by C. T. Brock
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>and his brother, Arthur Brock, who succeeded him in the
    business on March 25th, 1881, have since become proverbial.
    They continued up to 1910, when the Crystal Palace was
    taken over by the promoters of the Pageant of Empire. They
    have been revived in 1920, when the War Museum was opened,
    and the attendance has proved that the public taste for fireworks
    is very far from diminishing.</p>

  <p>During the run of forty-five consecutive years an installation
    was built up, method and technique were evolved
    unknown in any other place of pyrotechnic exhibition.</p>

  <p>While the firework terrace, with its magnificent background
    of park and shrubberies, is unrivalled as a firing
    ground, it is at the same time the most exacting. The huge
    building, its imposing position and setting, the wonderful
    fountains, all demand pyrotechnic effects on a corresponding
    scale.</p>

  <p>The pictorial set pieces, originally introduced by C. T.
    Brock in 1875, increased in size until a plant was arrived
    at capable of exhibiting a picture ninety feet high and two
    hundred feet long on the main girder, which length could
    be extended to even six hundred feet of frontage, as on the
    occasion of the exhibition of a battle piece or similar subject.</p>

  <p>During this period the subjects dealt with in the main set
    pieces have covered a wide range. A favourite subject, and
    one lending itself particularly well to pyrotechnic production,
    is the sea battle. Almost every historic naval engagement of
    sufficient size to warrant its adoption has been proved the
    subject for a fire picture.</p>

  <p>Among the battle pictures produced are the following:&mdash;Bombardment
    of Alexandria in 1882, Siege of Gibraltar in
    1883, Battle of Trafalgar in 1884; during 1885, two pictures
    representing the use of the ironclads of the period and based
    on the Naval man&oelig;uvres, entitled the &ldquo;Attack on Dover,&rdquo;
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>and the Battle of Bantry Bay; the following year another
    imaginary picture depicting an attack by torpedo boats on the
    latest battleship, the &ldquo;Colossus.&rdquo; The Bombardment of
    Sebastopol was reproduced in 1887, followed by the Jubilee
    Naval Review at Spithead. In 1888 the defeat of the Spanish
    Armada was depicted; in 1890 Trafalgar, followed in 1891
    by the engagement between the &ldquo;Chesapeake&rdquo; and the
    &ldquo;Shannon,&rdquo; together with a portrait of Admiral Sir Provo
    Wallis, then aged one hundred, and another from an early
    painting showing him at the time of the engagement when
    the command of the English vessel devolved upon him owing
    to the casualties among the senior officers. Later in that year
    the Battle of the Nile was reproduced; 1893 saw the Bombardment
    of Canton; 1894 the Battle of the First of June,
    and the Battle of the Yalu. The Battle of Manilla Bay was
    produced in 1898, and on the centenary date the Battle of the
    Nile. In 1889, H.M.S. &ldquo;Implacable&rdquo; was shown in action
    on the day on which she was commissioned, followed in 1900
    by the Bombardment of the Taku Forts, and in 1901 by the
    immortal sea fight between the &ldquo;Revenge&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Fifty-three.&rdquo;
    In 1904 the Russo-Japanese War gave subjects in the
    various attacks on Port Arthur and the Battle of Tsu-Shima,
    and the Battle of the Sea of Japan in the year following. The
    Battle of Trafalgar was renewed that season, and in 1908
    another imaginary picture portraying modern naval warfare
    was produced, followed in 1909 by an imaginary encounter
    between the first Dreadnought and other craft.</p>

  <p>The revival of the Crystal Palace displays in 1920 saw the
    reproduction of the Battle of Jutland, of which the following
    appreciation appeared in the Press:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;The chief set piece in the programme is a Fire Picture
      of the Battle of Jutland, the most realistic spectacle ever
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>produced in fire; by ingenious devices the guns fire, shells
      burst in all directions, gaping holes appear in the sides and
      upper works of the ships engaged, until&mdash;when the din of
      battle has reached its height&mdash;the German cruiser &lsquo;Lutzow&rsquo;
      blows up and sinks. One realises that here at least is
      one pictorial subject in which the Cinematograph is hopelessly
      outdone; the variety of noises, varying from the sharp
      bark of quick-firers to the boom of the heavy guns, which
      are here so wonderfully reproduced, are quite inadequately
      rendered by the conventional thumps on the big drum in
      the orchestra.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Before the resources of lance-work were fully understood,
    the reproduction of famous buildings was a fruitful source of
    subjects; those reproduced vary from the Crystal Palace itself
    to Worcester and Salisbury Cathedrals, and from the Arc de
    Triomphe to the Mosque at Delhi.</p>

  <p>Natural catastrophes such as the Avalanche, the Eruption
    of Vesuvius, and the Destruction of Pompeii have been
    portrayed. The Wreck of the Eider in 1892, with the rescue
    of the passengers by the lifeboats, formed the subject of a
    popular set piece; another successful scenic showed a wreck
    with line-throwing rockets and transport of passengers by
    the breeches buoy.</p>

  <p>In 1879 portraits in fire were reproduced for the first
    time, and since that date those executed have included almost
    all the Royal Personages of the day, many of which have been
    fired electrically from the Royal Box by the originals. Other
    eminent people reproduced range from King Cetewayo in
    1882, the Maori King in 1884, Li-Hung-Chang in 1896, to
    Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford in 1920.</p>

  <p>In 1887 what is known as the transformation set piece was
    introduced. Upon lighting, the piece exhibits a floral design in
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>colours, which, after burning some time, becomes transformed
    into a portrait, the lines of which are worked inconspicuously
    with those of the floral design, and, to use a modern term, camouflaged
    by its colours, the colour of the portrait being white.</p>

    <div class="caption">Firework Display for the Coronation Durbar at Delhi, January 3rd, 1903. In the background is the Jumma Musjid.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The first portrait to be so shown was Lord Beaconsfield,
    the floral design being of primroses, and the occasion Primrose
    Day. This, for the first example of its kind, was very
    successful, and later in the year an enormous transformation
    picture, 200 feet long and 100 feet high, was fired at the
    Jubilee display, changing to portraits of Queen Victoria and
    members of the Royal Family.</p>

  <p>A popular picture of this kind is the puzzle picture which
    transforms from a jungle scene to animals.</p>

  <p>Another most successful changing picture was entitled
    &ldquo;The Seasons,&rdquo; first produced in 1889, and revived from
    time to time. A rural scene changes from Spring to Summer,
    from Summer to Autumn, and finally to Winter. The effect
    is produced by varying compositions in the lances, and by
    employing lances of varying length, and requires very exact
    manipulation and supervision.</p>

  <p>Patriotic, congratulatory, and political cartoons and devices
    have been exhibited in wonderful variety of design, sentiment,
    and language: Chinese, Persian, and Maori, to mention
    only three of the latter.</p>

  <p>Living Fireworks, invented and patented by C. T. Brock
    and Co., in 1888, have always been a favourite feature of the
    Crystal Palace displays. The performer is clad in overalls of
    asbestos cloth, and on the side nearest to the spectators wears
    a light wood framework, of which the outline is &ldquo;lanced&rdquo;
    to depict the particular character to be portrayed.</p>

  <p>The first subject dealt with was the boxing match, which
    has enjoyed continuous popularity up to the present day, and
    is possibly the most successful.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

  <p>Other favourites have been Blondin on the tight rope,
    inspired by the appearance of the real Blondin on the firework
    terrace, surrounded by firework effects, in 1871;
    dancers of various kinds, from the Sailor&rsquo;s Hornpipe to
    Salome; Cat fights; Cock fights; the Boxing Kangaroo
    in 1893, when that performance was attracting crowds to the
    old Aquarium; an Indian Snake Charmer; a Fisherman;
    a Trapeze Artist, have all been produced by living actors in fire.</p>

  <p>In 1895 &ldquo;The Village Blacksmith&rdquo; was enacted, with
    horse, blacksmith, assistant, and horse&rsquo;s owner, with forge,
    bellows, anvil, and all necessary &ldquo;properties.&rdquo; The following
    year a piece was exhibited showing various members of the
    building trades at work. Then followed the Fire Scene, in
    which a house is seen on fire, the motor fire engine arrives,
    the men jump down, unroll the hose, and proceed to extinguish
    the outbreak with a jet of fire. Another ambitious
    effort showed a City policeman regulating the traffic. The
    most elaborate scene of the kind yet attempted was to work
    living figures in connection with the main set piece. The
    subject chosen was life in the Arctic Regions, and opened
    with the open Polar Sea, with whaling vessels, spouting
    whale, and launch of the whaling boat, which follows the
    whale and fires a harpoon. The picture then changed to Arctic
    winter, ice forms, and the vessel is frozen with the ice, sledging
    parties travel over the ice, and the picture concluded with
    a man and bear fight in living fireworks. The same year&mdash;1890&mdash;there
    was introduced into the Children&rsquo;s Fireworks,
    which form an annual feature of the Crystal Palace displays,
    a living Jack and the Beanstalk picture.</p>

  <p>In 1906 the then popular song, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t leave my
    little Wooden Hut for You,&rdquo; was the basis of what was
    described in the programme as a Living Firework Drama.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>The popular songs of the day have provided the subject for
    many successful set pieces, and form a class of picture which
    derives much of its success from the band accompaniment
    and the opportunity for vocal effort on the part of the crowd.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illow100" id="i052" style="max-width: 75em">
    <img src="images/i052.jpg" class="w100" width="1200" height="951" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">A Crystal Palace Set Piece at the time of the South African War. (200 ft. long by 70 ft. high.)</div>
  </div>

  <p>The origin of this type of picture is worth recording. In
    1889 the Shah of Persia visited the Crystal Palace, and fired
    a portrait of himself, electrically, from the Royal Box. A
    popular song of the day, &ldquo;Have you seen the Shah?&rdquo; was
    suggested to some musically inclined members of the audience,
    who commenced to sing it, and were soon joined by the whole
    of the spectators, numbering about 50,000.</p>

  <p>The effect of this impromptu concert was so striking as
    to lead to the production of the popular song whenever there
    happened to be one suitable for pictorial rendering in fireworks.</p>

  <p>In 1892 a mechanical Lottie Collins, 60 feet high, dancing
    to the then popular strain of &ldquo;Ta-ra-ra-bom-de-ay,&rdquo; was
    enthusiastically received. A series of patriotic and sentimental
    songs at the time of the South African War, as &ldquo;The Absent-minded
    Beggar&rdquo; and &ldquo;Good-bye, Dolly Grey,&rdquo; etc., were
    very successful. The &ldquo;Honeysuckle and the Bee&rdquo; provided
    the subject for a transformation picture, a design of honeysuckle
    changing to a girl&rsquo;s head with a mechanical bee twelve
    feet long.</p>

  <p>In 1908 three songs were included in one piece&mdash;&ldquo;Bill
    Bailey,&rdquo; &ldquo;Farewell, my Bluebell,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Old Bull and
    Bush.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The smaller mechanical pieces form a history of locomotion
    during the half-century covered by the displays.
    Bicycles, motor cars, looping the loop, aeroplanes, costers&rsquo;
    barrows, hansom cabs, fire engines, scooters have all been
    represented, and in 1895, on the occasion of the visit of the
    Railway Conference, two of the best mechanical pieces ever
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>carried out&mdash;full-sized representations of the &ldquo;Rocket&rdquo; and
    the latest type of express engine with exact details and working parts.</p>

  <p>An effective working device introduced as early as 1870
    was a comet travelling down a wire from one of the famous
    towers to the ground. Later the comet was replaced by a
    dragon, Mother Goose, and in 1872 by a &ldquo;Fiery Bicycle,&rdquo;
    a subject which seems somewhat out of place in such a position.
    The next development of this feature was to introduce a living
    man who, clad in shining armour and surrounded and illuminated
    by a frame of fireworks, striking an impressive attitude,
    slid from the summit of the tower to the terrace.</p>

  <p>The name of this performer, no doubt in imitation of the
    Italian artists who on a smaller scale carried out a similar feat
    at Vauxhall, was given in the programme as Signor Gregorini.
    In private life or in the works, however, he went by the name
    of Bill Gregory, and it is recorded that, when on the first
    night he stuck half-way down and had to remain in his airy
    position for the remainder of the display, his remarks left no
    doubt as to the country of his origin.</p>

  <p>It is characteristic of Mr. C. T. Brock that he who originated
    the idea was the first to try the descent. The weight of
    the cable was very considerable and the strain very heavy in
    order to keep it sufficiently taut, and doubts were expressed
    as to the advisability of putting such a stress on the structure,
    which led to the abandonment of the performance.</p>

  <p>It would be tedious to attempt to give anything like a
    description of the many and varied moving and stationary
    devices used in the Crystal Palace displays. The descriptions
    in the traditional somewhat flowery language of the firework
    programmes would convey little without illustration. One
    feature generally to be found in the programme is that of the
    wheels. These are generally fired in a group of three in the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>centre of the Terrace, the designs varying in form, movement
    and colour from time to time, the fire of the centre or
    largest wheel forming a circle one hundred feet in diameter.</p>

  <p>The historical displays during this period include the
    displays given in India in 1875–6, during the tour of King
    Edward, then Prince of Wales, at Bombay, Madura, Colombo,
    Madras, and Jaipur, and a series of enormous displays carried
    out at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876, at one
    of which 250,000 people paid half-a-dollar admission, and
    in 1877, the displays given at Calcutta and Delhi on the
    occasion of the assumption by Queen Victoria of the title
    Empress of India.</p>

  <p>The Jubilee and Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria produced
    enormous activity in the manufacture of fireworks.
    Displays great and small took place all over the United Kingdom,
    or rather, the Empire.</p>

  <p>Among the displays fired on the occasion of the Diamond
    Jubilee, certainly not the least interesting, although comparatively
    small in extent, was that given at Blantyre in the
    heart of the African continent. This display, which included
    a portrait of Her late Majesty, was carried up three hundred
    and sixty miles of the Zambesi, thence by canoe over eighty
    miles of sandbanks and mud, and finally thirty miles overland
    with a rise of 3,500 feet.</p>

  <p>Other displays were the display on the Tagus in 1886 on
    the occasion of the marriage of the late King of Portugal;
    the display fired from Brooklyn Bridge for the Columbus
    Tercentenary in 1892; the Imperial Fete on the Danube in
    1903; the display fired from thirteen battleships moored at
    a distance of a quarter of a mile from each other on the occasion
    of the &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Entente Cordiale</span>&rdquo; visit of the French Fleet in
    1905; the display celebrating the Tercentenary of the founding
    of Quebec in 1908; and the greatest display of fireworks
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>ever fired&mdash;the official Peace display in Hyde Park in 1919,
    in which some of the ground works suffered from the rain
    which, unfortunately, started about five o&rsquo;clock, but the aerial
    work was on an unprecedented scale, shells varying from
    sixteen inches down to 5&frac12; inches in diameter being fired in
    salvoes of twenty-five to one hundred.</p>

  <p>Rockets of 1 lb. were fired in flights of one hundred, and
    a final flight of three thousand; sets of Roman candles, each
    containing two hundred; one hundred fiery jets, etc., etc.
    The &ldquo;Fourth of June&rdquo; celebration at Eton has always been
    the occasion of a firework display, and displays have taken
    place annually, with the exception of the years of the Great
    War, from at least as early as the beginning of the nineteenth
    century. Hone, in his &ldquo;Everyday Book&rdquo; (1831), speaks of
    the fireworks as a well-established feature of the festival.</p>

  <p>It is possible, and even probable, that they date from the
    reign of George <abbr title="the third">III</abbr>, on whose birthday the event takes place.</p>

      FIREWORK MANUFACTURE</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span> manufacture of fireworks in this country, as an
    industry distinct from mere firework making, dates
    from the early part of the eighteenth century. Before
    that period displays appear to have been generally carried
    out by the military, or at any rate under the control of artillery
    or engineer officers. At that time the art was considered to
    have two distinct branches, civil and military pyrotechny,
    the latter class naturally attracting most attention during a
    period when Europe was almost continuously at war, and when
    firearms had made little progress from the early types.</p>

  <p>As has been previously mentioned, Jones complains that
    when it was required to carry out a display of fireworks on a
    large scale, recourse was always had to foreigners to conduct
    it. One reason was that, apart from the actual making of the
    firework units, a display depends far more for its success on
    the experience and skill of the pyrotechnist in arranging and
    composing both the form and sequence of the pieces. The
    firework makers capable of carrying out a display on a large
    scale were very few; there were fewer, if any, in this country.
    The whole of the trade was illegal; under the statute of the
    9th and 10th of William <abbr title="the third">III</abbr> it was illegal to make, sell, or let
    off fireworks:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;By the 9th and 10th of William, Chap. 7, it is enacted:
      That if any Person shall make or cause to be made, or
      sell, give, or utter, or offer, or expose to sale any Squibs,
      Rockets, Serpents, or other Fire-works, he shall forfeit
      Five Pounds. And that if any Person shall permit the
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>same to be fired from his House or Premises, or shall cast
      or fire, or be aiding and assisting in casting or firing the
      same in any public Street, House, Shop, River, or Highway,
      he shall forfeit Twenty Shillings, or be committed to
      the House of Correction to hard Labour for one Month.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This Act continued in force up to the passing of the Gunpowder
    Act in 1860. There were periods during which it was
    practically a dead letter, and again periods of sporadic activity.</p>

  <p>The first restriction of the public use of fireworks appears
    to have been an order in council dated November 6th, 1685,
    which &ldquo;For the preventing of Tumultuas Disorders&rdquo; and
    with the object of &ldquo;Disappointing the Evil Designs of Persons
    Disaffected to the Government, who commonly make
    use of such occasions to turn those Meetings into Riots and
    Tumults,&rdquo; enacted that &ldquo;No Person or Persons whatsoever,
    do presume to make or encourage the making of any Bonfires,
    or other Publick Fire Works&mdash;without particular permission
    Leave in Order&mdash;upon Pain of His Majesty&rsquo;s Displeasure;
    and being Prosecuted with the utmost severity of
    the Law.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A notice appeared in the press of November 1st, 1788,
    dated from the &ldquo;Public Office, Bow Street,&rdquo; warning the
    public against firing crackers in the street, and quoting the
    Act &ldquo;that no Person may claim Ignorance thereof.&rdquo; Again,
    in 1814, &ldquo;The Times&rdquo; has an account of a summons under the
    Act of a William Swift, &ldquo;for exposing for sale, Squibs, Serpents,
    Crackers and Fireworks of other descriptions to the
    great danger and annoyance of the public and contrary to
    the Statute.&rdquo; The report continues:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Mr. Laws in opening the case observed, that this was
      a prosecution brought forward at the recommendation of
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>the Magistrates of Union-Hall, who, however, did not by
      it seek to punish the defendant with severity but only to
      inform him and others acting like him, that the Act upon
      which the present indictment was founded and which so
      far back as the reign of William <abbr title="the third">III</abbr>, was passed for the
      protection of the public, though it had not lately been acted
      upon, was still in force. The defendant, it appeared, was a
      man of property and a respectable holder residing in Falcon-Court,
      where he had for some time past carried on the
      profession of a firework-maker. The officers of Union-Hall
      having heard, however, that he was in the habit of supplying
      boys or any person who applied indiscriminately with
      these dangerous commodities, they determined, if possible,
      to put a stop to this traffic, so dangerous to the public
      safety. For this purpose they sent a person, properly instructed,
      to purchase some; Goff, Bruce, and some other
      of the officers remaining near the door to detect him coming
      out; the purchase was made, and as the purchaser was
      quitting the house, the officers stopt him and forced their
      way in. They proceeded to search the premises, and concealed
      in closets and other parts, they discovered a vast
      quantity of fireworks of various sizes and descriptions,
      amounting to 19,600 and weighing upwards of 6 <abbr title="hundredweight">cwt.</abbr>,
      several of these, singly, were large enough to have spread
      ruin through the neighbourhood, had they by accident
      exploded. These the officers took away and deposited at
      the Office, where they still remained to the great annoyance
      of the Magistrates waiting the decision of this question.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Hone, in his &ldquo;Everyday Book,&rdquo; records that at that
    time, 1825, &ldquo;A Corporation notice was annually left at the
    house of every inhabitant in the City of London, previous
    to lord mayor&rsquo;s day.&rdquo; The following (delivered in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bride&rsquo;s)
    is its form:</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="right">&ldquo;<i>October the 11th, 1825.</i></p>

    <p class="noindent">Sir:</p>

    <p>By Virtue of a Precept from my Lord Mayor, in
      order to prevent any Tumults and Riots that may happen
      on the Fifth of November, and the next ensuing Lord
      Mayor&rsquo;s Day, you are required to charge all your
      Servants and Lodgers, that they neither make, nor cause
      to be made, any Squibs, Serpents, Fire Balloons, or other
      Fireworks, nor fire, fling, nor throw them out of your
      House, Shop or Warehouse, or in the Streets of this City,
      on the Penalties contained in an Act of Parliament made
      in the Tenth year of the late King William.</p>

    <p>Note. The Act was made perpetual, and is not expired,
      as some ignorantly suppose.</p>

    <p class="right">C. Puckeridge, <i>Beadle</i>.</p>

    <p class="center">Taylor, Printer, Basinghall Street.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>During the period of the operation of the Act, that is from
    the end of the seventeenth to the middle of the nineteenth
    centuries, on the occasion of public rejoicing, the authorities
    were in the anomalous position of employing persons to
    break the law, both by manufacturing and displaying fireworks.</p>

  <p>Although, as we have seen, this Act had very little effect
    on the quantity of fireworks manufactured, it had considerable
    adverse effect on the industry. As the whole thing was
    illegal, no regulations were framed to control the making,
    storage, or distribution of fireworks, or the safety of either
    workers or public. The manufacture was conducted on lines
    which, at the present time, appear inconceivably reckless.
    Several people working in one room in a crowded building,
    with loose composition and gunpowder, and a fire in an open
    grate round which finished or partially finished goods were
    put to dry, and this in a thickly populated area of London.</p>
  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>
  <p>The result of this state of affairs, as might have been expected,
    was a continuous series of explosions of a more or less
    serious nature.</p>

  <p>An early press account, dated 1722, relates to &ldquo;Mr.
    Goodship of White Alley in Chancery Lane,&rdquo; and continues,
    &ldquo;as he was making some fireworks, the Gunpowder took
    fire and blew him up, by which means the House was fired,
    and that adjoining somewhat damaged. More Mischief had
    been done, but that there was timely help. The Man is so
    hurt that his life is despaired of.&rdquo; Another account gives the
    man&rsquo;s name as Goodsheaf.</p>

  <p>The early part of the nineteenth century provided an
    extraordinary list of accidents.</p>

  <p>In 1810 we find the following account of an accident at Bath:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;On Monday a dreadful accident happened at Bath to
      Mrs. Invetto, a firework-maker, and a young man her
      assistant. They were preparing sky-rockets, etc., for the
      Jubilee, when, by some means, an explosion took place of
      a considerable quantity of powder, some say upwards of
      two hundred barrels, which blew the house, and another
      adjoining, to atoms. The unfortunate woman was miserably
      burnt and bruised; and no hopes are entertained of
      her recovery. The poor fellow also lies in a shocking state
      at the Casualty Hospital at Bath.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In 1814 two accidents are recorded to Mortram and
    Clithero. The former took place in the &ldquo;Westminster Roade,
    near the Asylum&rdquo;; a man and two boys were very badly
    burned, two succumbing to their injuries the same day.
    Clithero&rsquo;s establishment was situated in Fleet Street Hill,
    Bethnal Green. The accident here was caused by fire from
    the steam engine reaching some fireworks. Three people
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>were badly injured, and much glass was destroyed in the
    neighbourhood. Clithero appears to have had his works
    separate from the dwelling-house, an arrangement which
    appears to be the exception rather than the rule. Mortram&rsquo;s
    premises were again destroyed in 1818, fortunately without
    loss of life.</p>

  <p>A serious accident took place in 1815, in which five people
    lost their lives, the premises, and those on either side, being
    demolished, and nearly all windows destroyed within two
    hundred yards. The proprietor of the premises, which were
    situated at Wilkes Street, Spitalfields, was Lushalan.</p>

  <p>In 1821 a third accident occurred at Mortram&rsquo;s works,
    the newspaper account of which gives an illuminating glimpse
    of the extraordinary methods of the period:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Tuesday morning an accident, which occasioned considerable
      alarm, and might have been attended with
      dangerous consequences, took place in the house of M.
      Mortram, firework-maker, in Westminster Road. It appears
      that one of the boys employed in making composition stars
      for rockets had placed a number of them on the fender
      before the fire to dry, and had set fire to one on the hob,
      which falling in amongst the others, the whole exploded,
      by which a little girl was much hurt in the back, and so
      frightened that she ran to the window of the first floor, but
      was prevented jumping out. The boy escaped up the area
      with his jacket on fire. The neighbours were now much
      alarmed, fearing that the fire might spread to more combustible
      matter in the house, and so on to the extensive
      workshops of Madame Hengler, the celebrated pyrotechnic
      to his Majesty; but, through the activity of the
      workmen, who ran into the adjoining house with buckets
      of water, further damage was happily prevented, or the
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>consequences might have been dreadful. An accident of a
      shocking nature, it will be recollected, occurred about three
      years since in the same person&rsquo;s repository, when two men
      were killed by the explosion.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In 1825, in Bell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Weekly Messenger&rdquo; of September 4th,
    appears the following account:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="center">&ldquo;DREADFUL EXPLOSION IN WHITECHAPEL.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Yesterday morning, about half-past eight o&rsquo;clock,
      Whitechapel Road, and the numerous streets that abound
      there, were thrown into the greatest state of agitation, by
      the inhabitants experiencing a most tremendous shock, as
      if caused by a volcano or an earthquake. The houses for a
      considerable distance were deserted by their inhabitants,
      and men, women, and children were seen running about in
      all directions, under the impression that the world was at
      an end. It was soon ascertained that their alarm was produced
      by the explosion of the factory of Mr. Brock, the
      artist in fireworks, at <abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 11, Baker&rsquo;s Row, Whitechapel
      Road, nearly opposite the London Hospital.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The following particulars relative to this direful disaster
      have reached us:&mdash;Mr. Brock has resided for the last
      five years in Baker&rsquo;s Row, and at the back of his dwelling-house
      is his repository for fireworks, where they are manufactured.
      This building is about 50 feet by 20 feet, and
      contains three magazines, which are lined with lead, and
      would be perfectly secure from fire, should it occur, on any
      of the adjoining premises. In these receptacles were deposited
      all the powder, composition, and, in fact, all the
      combustible matter, and Mr. B. was remarkable for the
      method he had taken to prevent any accident occurring on
      his premises. A few weeks since he had taken two boys out
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>of the poor-house to instruct in the art of firework making
      and he kept them chiefly employed in filling and ramming
      the cases of the sky-rockets, serpents, squibs, etc. The
      latter part of this stage of the work is done by a funnel, or
      piece of tin made in the shape of an extinguisher, and a
      small piece of iron wire, about a foot long, which is used
      as a ramrod. The small end, or nipple, as it is called, of
      the extinguisher is introduced into one end of the rocket
      or squib, and the boys ram the powder and wadding down
      with the ramrod. Yesterday morning, at the time above
      stated, Mr. Brock and his men left the factory to go to
      breakfast, leaving the two boys engaged at the work-board,
      ramming the sky-rockets. They had scarcely sat down to
      their meal when they, as well as the inhabitants around
      them for some distance, heard a sort of rumbling noise as
      if of some distant thunder, and the next moment a tremendous
      and deafening explosion followed, and the air
      was illumined with lights of various descriptions, and
      accompanied by continued reports. The concussion thus
      occasioned was so great that the inmates in the different
      houses were shaken from their seats, many of whom were
      sitting at their breakfast, and the tables and tea-things
      were upset and broken to pieces. The window frames were
      all forced out, and the brickbats and materials were flying
      about in every direction. The roofs of Mr. Brock&rsquo;s manufactory,
      and the factory of Mr. M&rsquo;Devitt adjoining, were
      blown to a considerable height, and the falling materials
      did considerable mischief. After the agitation was somewhat
      subsided, an inquiry into the cause of the accident
      took place, when it appeared from the statement of the two
      boys (who were blown a considerable height and were
      much injured) that they were at work, ramming the rockets,
      when the ramrod struck against the funnel, and the friction
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>caused a spark, which flew into the bowl of gunpowder
      that stood near them; this soon exploded, and ran like a
      train to all the other fireworks in the factory, and at length
      communicated to the magazines, which caused the disaster.
      Mr. Brock, however, declares that it could not have arisen
      in that way, as the nipple of the funnel was copper, therefore
      a friction would not cause a spark. One poor woman,
      sister to the beadle, who lives next door to Mr. Brock, was
      so dreadfully injured by the broken glass that she lies in
      the London Hospital without hopes of recovery. Ten
      houses were seriously damaged, and over sixty had their
      windows broken from top to bottom.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It will be seen from the foregoing that Brock was in advance
    of his time as regards precautions against explosions, which,
    however, in this case proved to some extent ineffective.</p>

  <p>An accident took place in 1838 at the premises of Cockerill,
    in Paradise Row, Lower Road, Islington. Three persons were
    killed, and the proprietor was so severely hurt in an attempt
    to rescue his family that he died later.</p>

  <p>The following year an accident took place at 6 Edward
    Street, Bethnal Green, in which three persons were injured.
    The explosion was caused by a spark from the fire falling on
    a quantity of loose powder lying on the table, the flash from
    which was communicated to a barrel of powder near. The
    report continues: &ldquo;The most miserable negligence was
    displayed by the persons engaged in the fabrication of the
    fireworks, as just previous to the accident one of the individuals
    was making a squib by the fire with a lighted pipe in his
    mouth.&rdquo; The pyrotechnist&rsquo;s name is not recorded.</p>

  <p>An explosion took place in 1841 at 6 Hatfield Place, Westminster
    Road, Lambeth, at the works of Drewett. Considerable
    damage was done, but fortunately no one was injured.</p>
  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span></p>
  <p>In 1857 Darby&rsquo;s factory at 98 Regent Street, Lambeth
    Walk, was destroyed. The upper part of the house was used
    as bedrooms, with the stock below; the whole of the premises
    and stock were destroyed, the occupants of the bedrooms,
    who were cut off, being rescued by the aid of ladders. On this
    occasion the gunpowder appears to have been stored in a
    magazine away from the house. The report adds that the same
    premises had suffered in a similar manner on one or two
    previous occasions, and subsequently, in November, 1873, a
    disastrous explosion at the same premises resulted in the loss
    of no fewer than eight lives. In 1858 a serious explosion took
    place at Madame Cotton&rsquo;s factory in the Westminster Bridge
    Road.</p>

  <p>The above-mentioned accidents do not comprise anything
    like a complete list, but tend to show the lines on which the
    manufacture of fireworks was conducted during the period
    covered.</p>

  <p>The frequency of such occurrences and the danger entailed
    to third parties pointed to the necessity of action of
    some kind. The old Act might have been put into force, but
    by so doing the industry would be stamped out, an industry
    which found employment for a large number of workpeople,
    and besides giving amusement and entertainment to many,
    provided signal lights and rockets, the demand for which was
    steadily increasing.</p>

  <p>There were at this time a considerable number of firework
    makers in London, particularly in the east and south of the
    Thames. Much of the work was given out to the workpeople&rsquo;s
    families to make up in their own homes. Workmen now living
    can remember, as children, seeing crackers, squibs, and other
    small goods being manufactured in bed and living-rooms of
    tenement houses in crowded districts, with open fires in the
    grates and several pounds of powder in a corner of the room.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>The materials were either given out at the factory and a piecework
    rate paid for making up, or the workers bought their
    own materials at the local shops, which in these districts kept
    what was required, and sold them to the factory on completion.
    It was then a common practice for a maker who had
    completed a &ldquo;frame&rdquo; of quickmatch to take it round to the

    <div class="caption">THE EXPLOSION AT MADAME COTON&rsquo;S FIREWORK FACTORY, WESTMINSTER ROAD.<br />
      From &ldquo;The Illustrated London News,&rdquo; 1858.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Considered from the point of view of modern practice,
    the wonder is that there were not more accidents than actually
    took place.</p>

  <p>The Gunpowder Act of 1860 was an attempt to place the
    manufacture and storage of explosives generally on a more
    satisfactory footing. It laid down regulations to be &ldquo;observed
    with regard to the manufacture of loaded percussion caps,
    and the manufacture and keeping of ammunition, fireworks,
    fulminate of mercury, and any other preparation or composition
    of an explosive nature&rdquo;; and makes it lawful for
    Justices of the Peace in Quarter Sessions to license places for
    the manufacture and storage of such articles, and to grant
    licenses to persons to sell fireworks.</p>

  <p>It also provided for the installation of lightning conductors
    in explosive magazines.</p>

  <p>This Act, although far from perfect, was a step in the
    right direction; it had the effect of bringing some makers out
    from the back streets of crowded districts, to construct properly
    arranged factories, or at any rate, factories planned with some
    regard to their use.</p>

  <p>Four years after the passing of the Act, public attention
    was sharply drawn to the matter by an explosion on an unprecedented
    scale at Erith, where several of the gunpowder
    manufacturers had magazines. Enormous damage was done,
    and many lives lost, over an area ten miles in radius. Lieutenant-Colonel
    Boxer, R.A., Superintendent of the Royal
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>Laboratory, Woolwich, in his report on this explosion, draws
    attention to the need for a system of inspection of explosive
    establishments, with the result that he was himself authorised
    to make such inspection.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant-Colonel Boxer was succeeded in 1870 by
    Captain (afterwards Colonel) Sir V. D. Majendie, K.C.B.,
    who recommended the appointment of permanent Explosives
    Inspectors.</p>

  <p>The late C. T. Brock, who commenced the long run of
    Crystal Palace displays in 1866, found his works insufficient
    for the large supply of material required for such displays,
    and commenced the construction of a factory on new lines
    at Nunhead. It was here in 1872 that the Royal Commission
    witnessed a series of experiments, the programme of which is
    here reproduced.</p>

  <p>It was upon the results of these experiments that the provisions
    of the Explosives Act of 1875, in so far as they relate to
    fireworks, are based.</p>

  <p>This Act is still in force, and is unlikely to be superseded
    for many years to come. There can have been few Acts which
    have, since their inception, proved so satisfactory to the industry
    controlled by them, either in the results achieved, or
    in the manner of their administration.</p>

  <p>The Explosives Acts of 1860 and 1875 took the then proscribed
    art of pyrotechny from back streets and crowded districts,
    rehoused it in properly designed and conducted factories
    in rural or suburban districts, making it as healthy and safe
    an occupation as almost any in the country.</p>

      MODERN FIREWORK MANUFACTURE</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Fireworks</span> are now manufactured under the Explosives
    Act of 1875 and Orders in Council <abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 2 and <abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 4 under that Act.</p>

  <p>Order in Council <abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 4 deals with small Firework Factories,
    the total contents of which, either finished or in course of construction,
    do not exceed 500 lbs. This class of factory presents
    little of interest for consideration; and is governed by practically
    the same rules as are the larger establishments of the
    kind, with such modifications as are justified by the small
    quantity of explosive material involved.</p>

  <p>Order in Council <abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 2 sets out the general rules to be
    observed in factories licensed under the Act, the leading
    points of which are as follows:</p>

  <p>The absence of iron or steel in any workshop, carriage, or
    boat; cleanliness and absence of grit; care as to material
    liable to spontaneous ignition; provision of lightning conductors
    on magazines; tools and implements to be of soft
    metal; working clothes without pockets; shoes without
    nails; searching or means to prevent the introduction of
    matches or dangerous substances into the works; materials
    and finished work to be removed from working buildings and
    not allowed to accumulate when any particular process is
    completed; no person under sixteen years to be employed or
    enter any danger building. Every building to be provided
    with a set of these rules, and a statement of the quantities of
    explosives and ingredients, and the work to be carried on in
    it as allowed by the license.</p>

  <p>The modern factory is generally situated in a rural district
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>on account of the fact that it is more easy to observe the
    statutary distances from protected works. Protected works
    referred to in the Act include other workshops and magazines
    in the factory, and also dwelling-houses, factories, institutions,
    railways, highways, and various undertakings and
    buildings, the distances to be observed varying with the
    nature of the protected work from public highways to palaces
    or houses of residence of the King, his heirs and successors.
    In some cases, as with private dwelling-houses, the distance
    to be observed is about half, if the consent of the occupier to
    the erection of the factory building or magazine is obtained.</p>

  <p>Firework factories, in fact all explosive factories, are constructed
    on the principle of limiting the scope and effect of
    any explosion that may take place to the smallest possible
    quantity of material and to the smallest possible risk to human
    life.</p>

  <p>The working buildings are constructed with a door at
    either end to facilitate escape in case of danger; the quantity
    of chemicals and of partially or wholly finished fireworks is
    strictly limited, as is the number of persons employed in the
    building. This number varies with the nature of the operation
    being carried out, from one in the case of the most hazardous
    to six in some cases.</p>

  <p>The working buildings are of light construction; the
    form most in use is a timber framing lined with matched
    boarding and covered externally with corrugated iron. No
    iron fittings are used, or iron nails left exposed in the interior.
    The floor is covered with linoleum, which is secured by copper
    tacks.</p>

  <p>The distance separating working buildings is, generally
    speaking, twenty-five yards, or if a suitable screen is placed
    between two such buildings, this distance may be reduced to
    twelve yards.</p>
  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>
  <p>The workpeople are provided with non-inflammable outer
    garments, no pockets are allowed, and suitable overshoes of
    sewn leather or indiarubber are provided.</p>

  <p>All tools are of soft metal, such as brass or copper, or of
    wood.</p>

  <p>The regulations refer, of course, only to those buildings
    in which explosive work is carried on, that is to say, buildings
    in the danger area as distinct from the non-danger area.</p>

  <p>The buildings in the danger area are working buildings,
    drying-rooms, expense and factory magazines. Expense
    magazines are those which are licensed for a comparatively
    small quantity of explosives, and from which explosive material
    is drawn as the work of the factory demands, or into which is
    put partially or wholly finished work either awaiting completion
    or transference to the main or factory magazines.</p>

  <p>The non-danger area includes stores for chemicals, paper,
    and other material, also case rolling and drying sheds, sawmill,
    wood-working and paper-cutting shops, offices, and
    similar buildings.</p>

  <p>The manufacture of fireworks begins with the making of
    the case or container, which, with the exception of shells
    and Jacks-in-the-box, are cylindrical in form.</p>

  <p>What are known as &ldquo;small goods&rdquo; are &ldquo;dry-rolled,&rdquo;
    that is, the outer edge of the paper only is pasted. They are
    then rolled up on a metal former on a slate slab.</p>

  <p>The larger cases, such as rockets, gerbs, and Roman
    candles, have the paper pasted all over, which is rolled up
    on the former and consolidated by repeated rolling between
    the slate slab and a board provided with a handle.</p>

  <p>There are two methods of introducing the composition
    into the cases&mdash;filling and charging.</p>

  <p>Filling is used where the composition does not have to be
    consolidated, and is done with a wire and funnel, or as it was
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>formerly called, a &ldquo;tun dish.&rdquo; The funnel has its outlet of
    such a size as to fit the case to be filled, the wire or rod is
    somewhat smaller than this outlet, and is provided at the
    upper end with a knob for the hand. The end of the funnel,
    which is filled with composition, is inserted in the upright
    case. The wire is then drawn up, thus freeing a small quantity
    of the composition which runs down into the case, the lowering
    of the wire pushing it into position. In order to render
    the downward movement more effective, the wire is often
    notched, but it is doubtful if this actually increases the
    efficiency. This action is rapidly repeated until the case is filled.</p>

  <p>This method, although simple, is very effective, and in
    the hands of a practised worker is exceedingly quick.</p>

  <p>Charging is adopted where the contents have to be solidified
    in the case. The composition is introduced in small
    quantities with a scoop of suitable size and consolidated by
    repeated blows with a wooden mallet on a &ldquo;drift.&rdquo; The drift
    is a cylindrical wooden tool of a size to fit the case, and an
    enlargement at the upper end to receive the blow of the mallet.</p>

  <p>The methods of charging the various forms of fireworks
    will be dealt with later under their separate headings.</p>

  <p>The method of charging rockets in use in the sixteenth
    century are those of to-day, and it is remarkable that no satisfactory
    alternative to hand charging has yet been devised.
    Mechanical hammering and hydraulic pressure have both
    been tried, but so far with limited success.</p>

  <p>Stars which are used in Roman candles and as garniture
    for rockets and shells, are of many kinds and combinations,
    but with the exception of some which are in effect complete
    miniature fireworks, they are constructed on one of
    three methods&mdash;they are either &ldquo;pumped,&rdquo; &ldquo;pinched&rdquo; or
    &ldquo;charged.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The pump used in the first of these operations consists of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>a short metal tube, which fits exactly a short metal plunger
    provided with a knob for the hand, and a small metal stud
    at the side. The tube has a slot cut partially down the side to
    receive this stud.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The method of using the pump is as follows:&mdash;The plunger
    is drawn up so that the stud rests on the top of the tube. The
    pump is pressed into a heap of prepared composition, which
    action has the effect of compressing the composition in the
    tube. The plunger is then turned so that the stud engages
    with the slot, and pushed down, forcing the star out of the
    tube. The composition is prepared for pumping by being
    damped with methylated spirit or some other suitable solvent,
    and after making, the stars are dried in specially constructed
    buildings.</p>

  <p>Pinched stars are made by pinching the damped composition
    into a short paper case, through which a short length
    of match is first passed.</p>

  <p>Charged stars have generally a clay or cardboard bottom
    to the case, and are usually matched. This form is generally
    used for Government signal rockets, as the composition being
    only at one end of the case, the time of burning is extended.</p>

  <p>The mixing of compositions requires great care and
    thoroughness. Care both on account of the necessity of exact
    adherence to the formula, and to preclude the presence of
    any foreign body or chemical which, apart from any effect it
    might have on the successful functioning of the fireworks for
    which it happens to be used, might render it most dangerous
    in manipulation.</p>

  <p>Generally working buildings are licensed for mixing compositions,
    but it is usual to set certain sheds apart for this
    purpose, especially if the chemicals used are of a dusty nature,
    that is, very finely divided, in which case the atmosphere
    becomes highly charged and dangerous.</p>
  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span></p>
  <p>Chlorate of potash, from the introduction of which into
    pyrotechny modern effects and colours may be said to date,
    has at the same time been responsible for many accidents. As
    will be seen in the later chapters on firework compositions, for
    many years chlorate of potash and sulphur were used freely
    in the same mixtures, and many as were the accidents caused
    by so doing, yet it is incredible that they were not far more
    numerous.</p>

  <p>Most makers were well aware of the dangerous nature of
    this admixture, but persisted in using it, as the colours so
    obtained were at that time unapproached by other means;
    naturally no manufacturer wished to be alone in the discontinuance
    of some of the most striking effects at the time available,
    or to give competition the consequent advantage.</p>

  <p>In August, 1893, a man was fatally burned whilst simply
    emptying a small quantity of crimson stars from one tray to
    another; the slight friction so caused was sufficient to ignite
    the stars and thus fire the whole contents of the building.
    This unfortunate accident took place at the works of C. T.
    Brock and Co., then at South Norwood, and seems even more
    unfortunate when one learns that with the exception of this
    particular crimson, they had practically eliminated chlorate
    and sulphur colours.</p>

  <p>The following year, by Order in Council <abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 15, the
    admixture of chlorate of potash and sulphur was made illegal.</p>

  <p>Previous to this accident, during the same year and in the
    same works, a serious accident involving the death of one
    workman and the injury of another, was caused by a barrel of
    chlorate of potash being delivered and marked nitrate of
    potash (saltpetre). Its use in a composition containing sulphide
    of arsenic (orpiment) produced a mixture approximately to that
    used in some fog signals and designed to fire by percussion.
    The natural effect was the serious explosion that followed.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

  <p>The late Sir Vivian D. Majendie, K.C.B., the then Chief
    Inspector of Explosives, records in his report that &ldquo;Messrs.
    Brock are extremely careful to keep chlorate and non-chlorate
    mixing departments, and even ingredients in separate buildings
    and under separate control,&rdquo; and while he considered
    that &ldquo;some measure of blame is attributable to them in respect
    of the defects of their system which rendered possible
    the presence of a cask of chlorate of potash as &ldquo;saltpetre&rdquo;
    in the saltpetre shed,&rdquo; he adds: &ldquo;It is only fair and proper
    that I should say that our experience of the manner in which
    Messrs. Brock conduct their large business generally is
    extremely satisfactory. This factory is in many respects a
    model; they have always shown themselves ready to discuss
    with us and adopt any suggestion tending to increase the
    safety of the workpeople.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>These indications, if such were needed apart from the
    official prohibition of the use of these two ingredients together,
    convinced Mr. Arthur Brock that even greater care
    was necessary in dealing with them. With this object in view,
    when the works were removed to Sutton, Surrey, the two
    factories at South Norwood and Harold Wood, Essex, being
    inadequate to deal with the business, the plan of the new
    factory was arranged so as entirely to separate that portion
    of the factory using chlorate of potash from the portion using
    sulphur. A road running up the factory from the entrance
    gate divides it into what are virtually two factories, known as
    the Colour and Bright Sides.</p>

  <p>These works, which are easily the largest of the kind in the
    world, cover an area of nearly 200 acres. They include about
    60 magazines, expense magazines, and drying rooms, with a
    total storage capacity of 1,300,000 lbs. of fireworks and 5 tons
    of gunpowder; 120 explosive working buildings (mostly
    double), besides numerous stores, non-explosive working
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>buildings, saw-mills, and wood-working shops. The buildings
    are connected by over four miles of tram-lines. The
    average number of employees is 150 men and 200 women.
    During the late war this number was increased to over 2,000
    on the manufacture of munitions.</p>

      FIREWORK ACCIDENTS</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span> record of firework accidents until the date of
    the Explosives Act, 1875, is very meagre, not in subject
    matter, as reference to Chapter <abbr title="6">VI</abbr> will show,
    for the history of the industry up to that time appears to have
    been one catalogue of accidents; the only cause for wonder
    when one considers the conditions then prevailing is that
    there were not more. But in detail, the only records are more
    or less sensational reports of the event, and such explanation of
    the cause as the reporter could pick up from some bystander.</p>

  <p>In some cases where the workers were not killed the explanation
    was found to be simple; as for instance, the accident
    at Mortram&rsquo;s works in 1821. Here a boy who was making stars
    in a room with several other workers and other composition
    present, put some of his work to dry before the open fire,
    and as if this was not a sufficiently reckless proceeding, lit
    one on the hob, with the consequences that were to be expected.</p>

  <p>In most cases, however, the cause seems to have been
    obscure, and little or no trouble appears to have been taken
    to discover the cause with a view to prevention of a repetition.</p>

  <p>Since the Explosives Act careful record is kept of all
    accidents; the scene of the accident is inspected, and a report
    printed, setting out the cause, so far as can be ascertained.</p>

  <p>Until the introduction of chlorate of potash about 1830,
    if even reasonable care had been used the chances of spontaneous
    ignition were very small, and it is reasonable to suppose
    that such accidents as did take place were in the majority
    due to such incidents as the above.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

  <p>After that date, however, it is not too much to say that
    quite as large a proportion of accidents were due to the
    admixture of chlorate of potash and sulphur.</p>

  <p>We are, of course, now speaking of accidents during manufacture,
    although to the same cause may be attributed many
    of the numerous cases of bursting mortars during displays
    which were so frequent until the prohibition of this mixture
    in 1894 by Order in Council 15.</p>

  <p>Dr. Browne, of Hull, a consulting chemist, published in
    1884 a book entitled, &ldquo;Firework Accidents, their cause and
    prevention,&rdquo; in which he divides accidents into three classes:
    mechanical, chemical (spontaneous combustion), and mechano-chemical.</p>

  <p>Such a classification seems to the writer misleading, as all
    accidents must of necessity be chemical; that is to say, for
    combustion chemical action must take place; and with the
    exception of cases where ignition has taken place quite
    spontaneously, that is where the composition has ignited
    when lying perfectly undisturbed, all must be considered
    mechanical.</p>

  <p>Almost any composition used in pyrotechny, however
    stable, can be ignited by a violent blow between two hard
    surfaces, but some compositions are so unstable as to be
    ignited by very slight friction.</p>

  <p>It is therefore a question of degree, or whether the mechanical
    factor is most to blame or the chemical. A better classification
    would be:</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <ol class="inline" style="list-style-type:upper-roman">
      <li>Ignition caused by violence, friction or heat.</li>
      <li>Accidents caused by the state, condition or quality of
        the composition or ingredients.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <p>If the accident be included in the class which gives the
    fundamental cause of the accident, it will be found that the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>greatest number fall in Class <abbr title="2">II</abbr>, even though they may at first
    glance appear to belong to the first class.</p>

  <p>Class <abbr title="1">I</abbr> includes accidents caused by the accidental presence
    of fire and accidents caused by necessarily more or less violent
    action in manufacture, that is to say, in charging.</p>

  <p>Ignition during charging may be caused in two ways,
    either by a blow on composition between the charging tool
    or drift and the spindle or other hard surface, or by heat
    generated by repeated blows on the consolidated composition.</p>

  <p>In this class also should be put accidents, of which there
    are many, caused by playing or scuffing by the workpeople,
    the absence of safety overshoes, the presence of grit or iron
    or steel implements, in fact those caused by misconduct or
    negligence on the part of the workers, also the rare occasions
    where lightning has been the cause.</p>

  <p>Accidents caused by slight friction have to a great extent
    ceased to exist owing to the elimination of chlorate and sulphur
    compositions. Where accidents arise owing to instability of the
    composition, they most frequently at the present time fall
    within Class <abbr title="2">II</abbr>, as the instability of the composition is generally
    due to the presence of some impurity in one or more of
    the ingredients.</p>

  <p>Another source of accident of this class is the use of violence
    in emergency with a composition which, although not sufficiently
    stable for heavy charging, is quite safe for careful
    manipulation; as for instance, where force is exerted to clear
    a funnel which has become blocked with composition, or some
    similar action.</p>

  <p>As regards the part played by heat in accidents of this
    class, a study of the records clearly indicates how great is the
    influence of weather. By far the greatest number of accidents
    take place in the summer months; hot weather and a heavy
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>atmosphere are the most likely conditions to produce trouble
    for the pyrotechnist, although whether the primary cause is
    heat or owing to an electrical condition of the atmosphere it
    is difficult to say, probably it is the two conditions in conjunction.
    Sulphur and shellac, two very important ingredients
    in the art, are both capable of holding an electric charge,
    and it seems not unlikely that they may be so charged in an
    electric atmosphere during the process of mixing.</p>

  <p>Accidents in Class <abbr title="2">II</abbr> are generally less easily explained
    than those in the former class and have occurred in many
    forms. As has been said, during the period (about sixty-five
    years) from the introduction of chlorate of potash to the Order
    in Council forbidding its use with sulphur, numerous accidents
    occurred; spontaneous ignition, both whilst drying during
    manufacture and even during mixing, ignition from very
    slight friction, and for a time a frequent occurrence the detonation
    of the contents of shell by the lifting charge. During
    the period of seventeen years between the date of the
    Explosives Act and the prohibition of chlorate sulphur
    mixture, twenty-eight accidents are recorded, resulting in
    eleven deaths attributable to the use of such mixtures.</p>

  <p>The instability of chlorate sulphur compositions, however,
    does not appear to be so much due to the presence of these
    two chemicals themselves, but rather to the presence of impurity
    in conjunction with them.</p>

  <p>Commercial sulphur often contains free sulphurous acid,
    which acting upon the chlorate produces chlorine tetroxide,
    which rapidly decomposes and ignites the mass of the composition.</p>

  <p>Other acids which produce decomposition of the chlorate
    are equally likely to produce ignition. Of such cases, examples
    may be mentioned of acid being present in the paste used for
    case and box-making, also in gumwater which has been kept
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>some time before using, and in starch paste similarly treated.
    Spontaneous ignition has also been caused by the contact of
    oil with finely divided carbon such as lampblack or finely
    divided metals, such as magnesium and aluminium, which
    are so largely used at the present time.</p>

  <p>Another case of this nature is the heating up of cases after
    charging with gerb composition, two of the ingredients of
    which are sulphur and iron borings, this heating sometimes
    being sufficient to cause combustion. The cause of this phenomenon
    is the combination of the iron with sulphur to form
    sulphide of iron, this action being accompanied by heat. In
    fact, it is the same as that producing the experiment known
    as Lemery&rsquo;s volcano. As far as the knowledge of the writer
    extends, however, no occurrence of ignition has been definitely
    traced to this phenomenon, although it seems highly probable
    that even if ignition of the actual composition has not taken
    place, cases have occurred where more sensitive compositions
    have been fired by heat so generated where fireworks have
    been stored together.</p>

  <p>The annual reports of H.M. Inspectors of Explosives
    published since 1876 form an interesting and instructive
    summary of accidents in explosive trades, an examination of
    which throws considerable light on our subject.</p>

  <p>One is struck by the frequency with which explosions
    occur as a result of ignorance, generally on the part of amateur
    firework makers. In many cases, as where children are concerned,
    this ignorance is natural, but the want of knowledge
    and even reasonable care displayed by individuals whose
    occupation suggests at least some knowledge of the risk is
    indeed often extraordinary.</p>

  <p>Such a case occurred in 1884 in Devonshire, when a local
    chemist who was illegally manufacturing coloured fire, instructed
    an assistant to grind in an iron mortar a mixture
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>containing chlorate of potash and sulphur. The lad was killed
    in the resulting explosion.</p>

  <p>Even more remarkable was an explosion which took place
    in a railway carriage in 1893. This was due to the spontaneous
    ignition of a quantity of chlorate and sulphur coloured fire,
    which was being carried in an ordinary handbag by a gentleman
    whose occupation in life was that of professor of
    chemistry.</p>

  <p>An accident presenting considerable interest took place in
    1885 at Mitcham. The cause of this occurrence was quite
    simple. A man was fixing the curved stick which forms the
    pivot upon which a tourbillion rotates to one of those fireworks.
    The wire nail used for the purpose penetrated the
    composition and fired it. The remaining goods in the shed
    were ignited, and communicated to the neighbouring buildings,
    one of which was a magazine containing 3,000 lbs. of
    partially manufactured fireworks, including a number of
    rockets. These being without sticks and becoming ignited
    flew in all directions, setting fire to other buildings. The
    result was that ten buildings and an air drying rack
    were totally destroyed, and three buildings and three racks
    partially so.</p>

  <p>This would seem a very serious matter as far as monetary
    damage is concerned, but as regards the chief consideration
    in accidents of this kind, that is to say damage to human life
    and limb, the result was almost negligible; two persons were
    slightly injured.</p>

  <p>This accident, which was the most extensive in any firework
    factory since the Explosives Act came into operation,
    afforded striking proof of the efficiency of the precautions
    instituted under that Act.</p>

  <p>It is indeed extraordinary that in an explosive factory of
    considerable size, employing many workpeople, during working
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>hours it should be possible to destroy more or less completely
    seventeen buildings and only slightly injure two persons.</p>

  <p>It may be contended that the number of buildings damaged
    was very high, but it must be remembered that rockets without
    sticks take a most erratic course in their flight, rendering
    the effective screening of other buildings most difficult, if not
    impossible.</p>

  <p>However, there is evidence that many rockets were stopped
    by the screens, and that without their interposition the number
    of buildings destroyed might have been many times greater.</p>

  <p>The other Explosives Act requirements of which the efficiency
    was demonstrated by this accident, are the dividing
    of sheds into compartments with a limited number of workpeople
    in each, easy means of escape from working buildings,
    and the value of uninflammable clothing.</p>

  <p>It was also shown that a large quantity of fireworks might
    be burnt in mass without causing a veritable explosion; as
    in the case of the magazine containing 3,000 lbs.</p>

  <p>Contrasting with this occurrence are the reports of accidents
    in firework factories both on the Continent and in America.</p>

  <p>The same year, at Civita Vecchia, ten persons were killed
    and twice that number injured in one accident at a firework
    factory.</p>

  <p>Four years later, in Paris, seven girls were killed out of
    the eighteen employed in one compartment. The material
    being used was red phosphorus and chlorate. In 1882 fourteen
    persons were killed and no fewer than seventy injured at
    Chester, Pennsylvania.</p>

  <p>From 1891 to 1894 eight accidents in the United States
    are reported, resulting in a total of twenty-three deaths and
    injury to more than fifty persons. In 1894, at New Haven,
    Con., damage to the extent of 125,000 dollars was done, and
    at Dallas a considerable part of the city was destroyed.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

  <p>These are, of course, not a complete list, but only such
    cases as are brought to the notice of the English Home Office,
    but the extent of these clearly illustrates the value of the restrictions
    in force in this country.</p>

  <p>During the same years the total of firework factory
    accidents in this country was thirteen, in which three persons
    lost their lives, and in no case was more than one person killed
    in any one accident. Indeed, in one instance only since 1875
    has the number of deaths resulting from any accident exceeded
    two&mdash;on that occasion four deaths resulted.</p>

  <p>An interesting type of accident, examples of which have
    taken place on several occasions, is that in which two compositions,
    one containing sulphur and the other chlorate of
    potash, are placed in contact in the paper case of a firework,
    and produce spontaneous combustion.</p>

  <p>In one case a lance containing white and green composition
    burst into flame on the work bench. This provided an explanation
    to an explosion at the same factory which had taken
    place ten days before in a magazine containing between 6,000
    and 7,000 lbs. of display fireworks.</p>

  <p>An occurrence of a similar nature was observed at Brighton
    in 1903, when some changing coloured lights which had been
    removed from a building where a fire had taken place (the
    fireworks not being involved in any way) ignited some days
    afterwards.</p>

  <p>It is thought that the lights may have been wetted during
    the fire, and upon drying out some days later the different
    compositions in contact in the case or cases set up chemical
    action, which resulted in spontaneous ignition. It was found
    on examination that a blue containing sulphur was in contact
    with a green containing chlorate. It may be noted here that
    mixtures which are damped during manufacture are more liable
    to spontaneous ignition than those manipulated in a dry state.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

  <p>Many accidents and explosions are left unexplained, either
    because the evidence is destroyed by the resulting fire or by
    the death of the witness or witnesses, or because of the difficulty
    often experienced in getting the workpeople to give a
    full and faithful account of what occurred, fearing to cause
    trouble for themselves or others concerned.</p>

  <p>There can be no doubt that the cause is frequently carelessness
    or mistakes on the part of workers. In a large number
    of cases, however, this explanation gives no help and the
    cause remains obscure. One such may be mentioned:</p>

  <p>In 1902 an explosion occurred in a store for non-explosive
    ingredients, in which were kept the chemicals used in a firework
    factory. In the building at the time was a workman who
    appears to have been engaged in sifting chlorate of potash,
    and the technical manager of the factory who seems to have
    been weighing out ingredients. There is no doubt that he
    was a man of very considerable experience, and from his
    responsible position unlikely either to take risks or be guilty
    of carelessness.</p>

  <p>An explosion occurred in the building, killing both occupants,
    and of so violent a nature as to sever the foot of the
    manager and to project one of the sheets of corrugated iron
    with which the roof was covered a distance of thirty yards.</p>

  <p>No explanation of this occurrence was arrived at other
    than that in some way some of the chemicals must have
    become mixed to form a sensitive and violent explosive; so
    much is obvious, but how the chemicals became so mixed
    remains a mystery, as no mixing was actually done in the
    building. The ignition of such a mixture is less obscure as
    magazine boots were not necessary in the building owing to
    the non-hazardous nature of the work carried on there, and
    sufficient friction would be produced to fire even a fairly
    sensitive mixture between a nailed boot sole and a wood floor.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

  <p>An occurrence of considerable interest in this direction
    took place in a warehouse at Manchester in 1908. In the building
    were stored several tons of chemicals, among which were
    twelve tons of chlorate of potash and thirty-two of chlorate
    of soda.</p>

  <p>A workman stepping down from a barrel struck fire, and
    saw a flame, which he tried to extinguish by rubbing with his
    foot. This, however, had the opposite effect. He then tried
    a bucket of water, which failed to put it out; he left the building
    and heard an explosion, followed by a second and a third,
    all apparently of a violent nature, all three being heard nearly
    ten miles away, and glass broken throughout a considerable
    area round the warehouse.</p>

  <p>The cause appears to have been as follows: During the
    conveyance of the chlorate into the building leakings took
    place, and a certain quantity remained on the floor, this mixing
    with dust and other organic matter would prove a highly
    sensitive composition. This was ignited by the man&rsquo;s foot
    and rapidly spread, probably a deposit which had accumulated
    under the floor became involved. The woodwork of the building
    and the wooden barrels then became ignited. The rapid
    decomposition of the chlorate caused by the heat liberated
    large quantities of free oxygen, which united with carbon in
    the smoke to form gas, which exploded upon reaching the
    correct proportion for so doing.</p>

  <p>The writer has chiefly confined himself to accidents in
    firework factories; those occurring during the illegal manufacture
    of fireworks in premises unlicensed for the purpose
    present no further interest, and are generally caused by
    ignorance on the part of the participant of the often extremely
    dangerous nature of the material he is handling. To take an
    example:</p>

  <p>Two boys were engaged in grinding in a mortar a &ldquo;small
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>quantity&rdquo; of chlorate of potash and sugar. An explosion
    resulted which blew out the entire window frames of the
    room, destroyed the partition between the room and the
    passage, considerably damaged the other wall, and projected
    the pestle into the ceiling, where it remained embedded.</p>

  <p>Accidents at displays are now happily rare; the most fruitful
    cause of such happenings was the detonation of shell in the
    mortar, that is, the detonation of the contents or &ldquo;garniture&rdquo;
    by the explosion of the propellant charge.</p>

  <p>The elimination of chlorate-sulphur composition has
    reduced the chances of this to a minimum, and the compulsory
    burying of mortars up to the muzzle has practically
    eliminated the danger to either firers or spectators.</p>

  <p>Apart from slight injuries caused by falling rocket sticks
    and mishaps of a similar nature, accidents to the public at
    firework displays are things of the past.</p>

      SIMPLE FIREWORKS&mdash;ROCKET CLASS</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">In</span> the preceding chapters we have been dealing with
    displays of fireworks, that is to say; fireworks in the mass.
    We will now turn our attention to the firework units composing
    those displays, and endeavour to trace their gradual
    evolution from the crude originals.</p>

  <p>Fireworks may be divided into two classes, simple and
    compound. The first of these include fireworks which are a
    complete item in themselves, as the rocket, shell, or Roman
    candle; also the units which, fitted on a framework, go to
    compose the set pieces and devices of a display, and the small
    shop goods not used in displays. We will consider this class
    first.</p>

  <p>The two oldest forms of fireworks known are undoubtedly
    the cracker and the rocket. As we have already noted, both of
    these&mdash;or at least primitive forms&mdash;are mentioned by Marcus
    Graecus, Albertus, and Roger Bacon. The description by
    the former is sufficiently clear to leave no doubt in our minds
    that he is describing a rocket; although the description of a
    cracker is not so explicit as to enable us to say that he is actually
    describing a jumping cracker, yet his mention of folding and
    tying would certainly give colour to that belief. In fact, some
    writers have endeavoured to find a connection between the
    words &ldquo;Graecus&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cracker.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Greene, in &ldquo;Orlando Furioso&rdquo; (1599), uses the words,
    &ldquo;Yes, yes, with squibs and crackers brauly.&rdquo; John Bate, in
    his book previously mentioned, under the somewhat misleading
    heading, &ldquo;How to make Crackers,&rdquo; says: &ldquo;It is well
    knowne that every boy can make these, therefore I think it
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>will be but labor lost, to bestow time to describe their
    making.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He also describes a kind of kite which he designates a
    &ldquo;Fire Drake,&rdquo; to the tail of which he fastens &ldquo;divers crackers&rdquo;
    which are shown in the illustration to be exactly like the
    jumping crackers of the present day. Babington illustrates a
    cracker fixed to the top of a rocket.</p>

  <p>Pepys makes the following entry in his diary for November
    5th, 1661: &ldquo;Seeing the boys in the streets flying their
    crackers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The only practical difference between the cracker of 1635
    and that of to-day is in the difference of methods of manufacture,
    the early practice being to fold the gunpowder in the
    paper, the modern, to roll a paper case and fill the powder in
    through a funnel, afterwards flattening it through a roller mill.</p>

    <div class="caption">Cracker Making</div>
  </div>

  <p>Curiously enough, although the cracker has been in use
    for centuries in England, there appears to be no early reference
    to it on the Continent, the word &ldquo;petard&rdquo; meaning a
    cracker in French, but more often being applied to a firework
    with a single report, such as a maroon or cannon. The
    <cite lang="fr">Dictionnaire National</cite> of 1852, however, describes the true
    cracker as one of the meanings of &ldquo;petard.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The rocket is equal to the cracker in its claim to antiquity,
    and it is extraordinary that these two fireworks should have
    changed so little in form and composition.</p>

  <p>John Babington gives illustrations of rocket-charging tools
    and describes the manufacture of rockets, which are approximately
    those of the present day. It is only in the proportion
    of the ingredients that there is any considerable alteration.</p>

  <p>The word &ldquo;rocket&rdquo; appears to be Italian in origin, and
    to be based on the similarity in appearance of a rocket on its
    stick to the round piece of wood used in the Middle Ages to
    cover the point of a lance in mimic combat, and known as a
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>&ldquo;rockette,&rdquo; from &ldquo;rocca,&rdquo; the Italian word for a bobbin, a
    diminutive of distaff.</p>

  <p>As a rocket is the most important unit in the art of pyrotechny,
    a description of its manufacture will assist in the
    consideration of a large number of other fireworks which are
    either modifications of or based upon the underlying principles
    of the rocket, as well as the several principles governing
    all fireworks.</p>

  <p>The ingredients of rocket composition are those of gunpowder
    in approximately similar proportions, but the resultant
    composition is not gunpowder, the reason being that the
    ingredients are less intimately mixed, with the result that the
    combustion is spread over a longer interval of time. Instead
    of the whole mass deflagrating instantly, only the exposed
    surface is consumed. It is the recoil produced by the rush of
    gases, and partially consumed matter, from the violently
    burning composition which projects the rocket forward. The
    obvious form for the case containing the composition is cylindrical,
    both on account of ease of construction and of charging.
    In order to get the greatest possible reaction from the burning
    composition, the case of the rocket is constricted or
    choked, so that the fire may issue as it were in the form of a
    jet. This choke has one obvious disadvantage, it reduces the
    surface of composition to the area of the opening, thus restricting
    the initial burning surface at the time when the
    maximum of effort is required to force the rocket into motion.
    This defect is overcome by having a tapering hole up almost
    the entire length of the composition, thus giving a large burning
    surface with a consequent discharge of gas through a small
    orifice and a resultant powerful jet of fire and gas.</p>

  <p>The rocket case is of stout paper rolled on a former consolidated
    by rolling under a board. The choke is formed by
    inserting into the bore of the rocket two wooden tools with
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>rounded ends, the shorter tool having a peg projecting which
    is equal in diameter to the bore of the choke. The tools are of
    such length that when they are inserted the peg takes up the
    position where the choke is to be formed. The case is then
    constricted at this point by a strong pressure with a stout
    cord wound round the case and soaped to allow it to slip
    round easily.</p>

  <p>The case is then dried and charged by placing on a
    &ldquo;spindle,&rdquo; which is a strong gun-metal base with a nipple
    fitting into the vent of the rocket and having a tapering spindle
    which fits tightly in the choke and projects up into the bore
    of the rocket. The composition is poured in in small quantities
    measured in a scoop, each scoopful being consolidated
    by blows with a wooden mallet or a wooden &ldquo;drift&rdquo; hollowed
    to take the spindle. Before the first scoop of composition is
    introduced, the rocket is &ldquo;set down,&rdquo; that is, several blows
    are given on the drift to consolidate the paper at the choke
    and give it accurate shape. Next, a scoop of ground dry clay
    is poured in and charged firm as a protection to the paper of
    the choke. The charging is then proceeded with as detailed
    above. Varying drifts are used in order that the hole may
    approximately correspond with the diameter of the tapering
    spindle as the composition rises in the case.</p>

  <p>A short portion of the case above the spindle is charged
    solid; this is referred to as the &ldquo;heading,&rdquo; and is usually
    about one and a half times the bore in depth.</p>

  <p>Large rockets are charged in a mould which fits tightly
    round the outside of the case and prevents the case being
    split under the pressure of the blows whilst being charged.</p>

    <div class="caption">Rocket Manufacture, from Frézier&rsquo;s &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Feu
      d&rsquo;Artifice</span>,&rdquo; 1747.</div>
  </div>

  <p>In early times these moulds were used for all sizes and
    were of cast metal, and it is from them that the classification
    of the sizes is derived. Rockets are designated by the weight
    of a ball of lead which fits the bore of the corresponding mould.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>Thus we have rockets varying in size from &frac12; oz. to 6 lbs. and
    over, war rockets being made up to 9 and 24 lbs., but their
    use is now almost extinct.</p>

  <p>This classification, although it serves its purpose well
    enough, is somewhat misleading, as the thickness of the case
    varies in practice, at any rate under modern conditions. In
    the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries pyrotechnists seem to
    have had a standard proportion between the case and bore,
    <i>i.e.</i>, the thickness of the case was one-quarter the internal
    diameter of the rocket.</p>

  <p>In modern commercial practice a rocket&mdash;say for example
    of 1 lb.&mdash;is a rocket rolled on a former whose diameter is
    that of the bore of a 1 lb. rocket of standard thickness, but
    whose outside diameter is governed by the strength of the
    paper employed in the case.</p>

  <p>Several writers on pyrotechny, one Frézier writing in 1747
    in particular, have endeavoured to supersede this classification
    of rockets by replacing it with a series of internal diameter
    measurements, so far without success. It is hard to supersede
    the traditions of centuries on a plea of mere rationalism.</p>

  <p>Rocket compositions, although containing the same ingredients,
    namely, saltpetre, sulphur, and charcoal, have
    them in differing proportions. Broadly speaking, the larger
    the rocket the greater the proportion of charcoal and sulphur,
    the variations in proportion being considerable, from the
    half-ounce rocket mixing of 13 saltpetre, 2 sulphur, and 5
    charcoal to the 9 lb. and 24 lb. war rocket, with 13 saltpetre,
    3 sulphur, and 4 charcoal approximately, and even higher
    proportions of the second and third ingredients for special
    purposes. A larger proportion of charcoal gives a larger
    tail&mdash;a desirable feature in display and signal rockets. Some
    compositions have a proportion of mealed gunpowder to produce
    fiercer burning.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

  <p>Early makers appear to have used mealed gunpowder and
    added charcoal and other ingredients to, as it were, dilute
    the powder and render the deflagration less fierce. Babington
    (1635) adds charcoal in the following proportion:</p>

  <p>John Bate&rsquo;s compositions are rather erratically arranged;
    in some cases he adds the saltpetre, charcoal, and sulphur,
    and a further addition is &ldquo;yron scales,&rdquo; presumably to increase
    the effect of the tail, for which purpose later pyrotechnists
    used iron filings.</p>

  <p>The rocket having been charged to the top of the heading,
    clay is charged in, forming a diaphragm above it. Earlier
    practice was to turn down the top edge of the case on the
    heading composition to form a diaphragm.</p>

  <p>The best-known form of rocket is the sky rocket, which
    is fitted with a stick held in position by having a dowelled
    end introduced into a rolled paper or metal tube secured to
    the side of the rocket. The object of the stick is to direct the
    flight of the rocket, and further serves to hold it in position
    for firing, being passed through two rings at a suitable distance
    one above the other on a stake, through which it slides
    easily.</p>

  <p>Sky rockets are fitted with a &ldquo;cap&rdquo; containing the &ldquo;garniture&rdquo;
    of the rocket, which may take the form of &ldquo;stars&rdquo; or
    other pyrotechnic effects, or a gun-cotton wad, or similar
    explosive to make a sound signal, or small cases charged with
    picrate of potash, producing the well-known &ldquo;whistling
    rocket&rdquo; effect.</p>

  <p>The &ldquo;cap&rdquo; is either cylindrical or in the form of a truncated
    cone, with a conical or other top. The cap is burst open
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>and the contents ignited by an opening charge of powder
    lighted through a hole bored in the clay diaphragm above the
    heading, so that when the heading is burnt through the fire
    may be communicated to the opening charge.</p>

  <p>From earliest times the rocket has been the chief item in
    recreative fireworks; either the sky rocket as we know it to-day
    or its many modifications and derivatives was the chief
    constituent of the early displays.</p>

  <p>During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries a display
    would contain the following items&mdash;dragons or similar figures
    issuing from the scenic castle provided for the display; these
    would be moved by line rockets. A line rocket has no cap or
    garniture, the socket usually provided to hold the stick being
    lengthened, and of sufficient diameter to allow it to slide along
    a tightly stretched cord passed through it. Pieces of a similar
    nature to the modern fountain and gerb would be represented
    by &ldquo;ground rockets.&rdquo; This is a rocket less fiercely burning,
    charged solid, fixed to a support so that it remains stationary
    whilst burning, the fire being thrown out in a jet. Rockets
    would also be used to turn such primitive wheels as were
    exhibited, and to actuate mechanical scenic devices, which
    are in effect the &ldquo;turning cases&rdquo; of the present day. Serpents
    of fiz-gigs were much used, both as a garniture for rockets,
    and to give animation to wheels and similar pieces. These
    were made on the rocket principle, similar to the squib, but
    slightly more elaborate. A choke was formed between the
    composition and the &ldquo;bounce&rdquo; or powder giving the report.</p>

  <p>To-day the ground rocket has developed into the gerb or
    Chinese tree, fountains of various kinds, the flower pot&mdash;of
    the larger kinds; and among the smaller varieties, the squib
    with its variations, such as Black Jack and Blue Devil, and the
    golden rain with its variations.</p>

  <p>The modern, or rather more recent, method of heading
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>the rocket with a clay diaphragm evidently suggested that
    the choking of the case might be dispensed with where the
    composition was less fierce, the necessary reduction of the
    orifice being produced by a clay diaphragm with a central
    hole of sufficient size. This method is followed with the gerb,
    fountains, and flower pot, and in the firework known to pyrotechnists
    as &ldquo;fixt&rdquo;; this unit is largely used in display work
    to form the fringe frame or lattice effect of a set piece. &ldquo;Fixt&rdquo;
    are made in 1 oz. and 2 oz. sizes, and contain a composition of
    approximately one part of steel filings to four of mealed gunpowder
    and finish with a bounce. The origin of the name is
    uncertain: it may refer to their use on fixed pieces in contradistinction
    to one revolving, or&mdash;as is most probable&mdash;was
    first used to distinguish between a fixed and a moving rocket.</p>

  <p>The time of the introduction of the clay choke is uncertain.
    Jones, writing in 1765, although using clay in the heading of
    rockets, still choked all cases, but Mortimer (1824) uses it,
    although Ruggieri (1821), whilst doing the same, appears to
    think choking preferable.</p>

  <p>The former gives instructions for charging the clay solid
    and boring the central hole; Ruggieri, however, uses a nipple
    like a much shortened rocket spindle, in which he agrees with
    the modern practice. This method is also utilised at the
    present time for small-sized rockets.</p>

  <p>Of the fireworks of the fountain class, probably the first
    to develop from the crude rocket form were the gerb and
    flower pot. The gerb, or Chinese tree, contains a composition
    of saltpetre, sulphur, charcoal and iron borings, with the
    addition&mdash;if more force is required, as for instance to turn a
    device&mdash;of mealed gunpowder. Early makers used mealed
    powder alone and &ldquo;iron sand,&rdquo; or cast-iron reduced to powder
    by hammering. This composition is known as Chinese fire,
    and, as its name implies, was introduced into Europe from the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>East. An interesting article appeared in the &ldquo;Universal
    Magazine&rdquo; of 1764, written by a Jesuit missionary on the
    subject of Chinese fireworks. In it he describes the making of
    iron sand as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Old broken or useless pots serve generally for making
      this sand; they are broken into pieces of the breadth of
      the hand, after which, being made red-hot in the fire of a
      forge, they are thrown in that condition into a trough filled
      with fresh water, where they are left to cool. Thus calcined,
      the rust falls off in scales, and they are easily reduced into
      sand, being first broken into parcels of a finger&rsquo;s breadth.
      The anvil and hammer used for this purpose must be also
      of cast-iron, because steel flats the grains of sand. It is
      necessary that the angles of those grains should be sharp,
      as it is the angles that form the flowers.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The word &ldquo;gerb&rdquo; is derived from the French word meaning
    a sheaf of corn, and was first applied to water fountains.</p>

  <p>The flower pot is charged with a composition formerly
    known as &ldquo;spur-fire,&rdquo; from the resemblance in form of its
    coruscations to the rowel of a spur. The effect produced is
    one of the most effective when successful, but has the disadvantage
    for display work that the effect is only appreciated
    at close quarters. The ingredients used are lampblack, sulphur,
    red arsenic, saltpetre, with sometimes the addition of charcoal
    and mealed gunpowder.</p>

  <p>Of the smaller works of this division the squib and golden
    rain are too well known to need description. The squib and its
    variations have a choked case; the golden rain and similar
    works are left with an open bore.</p>

  <p>Squibs are generally filled with a composition of sulphur,
    saltpetre and charcoal, sometimes steel filings, with a bounce
    of fine-grain powder.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span></p>

  <p>A curious firework, now almost obsolete, for which it is
    difficult to find a class, is the five-pointed star. This work
    consisted of a case having a diaphragm of plaster of paris or
    clay above the filling, below which five holes are bored equidistant
    and at right angles to the axis. The case is fired in the
    unusual position of horizontal with the end towards the
    spectator, the fire playing all round the case, forming a star.
    The composition used was mealed powder, sulphur, saltpetre,
    and sulphuret of antimony. Ruggieri mentions this firework
    under the name &ldquo;Etoile fixé,&rdquo; and it is mentioned by Jones,
    writing in 1765, but not by Frézier.</p>

  <p>It is hard to believe that this unit was successful, so many
    factors militating against success, which depends upon the
    exactly similar jet from each of the five holes. But it is possible
    that in large geometrical pieces it was at least of use to give an
    additional effect in what, owing to the lack of variety of the
    fireworks of the time, must have been rather a monotonous
    repetition of a few effects. It also would enable small blank
    spaces to be filled in on set pieces. In a sun or star of the
    ordinary type, that is of radiating cases, the commencement
    of the jets must be as far apart as the length of two of the
    cases, which length is governed by the required time of
    burning. This leaves a blank centre; the five-pointed star,
    however, if working correctly, has the jets radiating from a
    point.</p>

  <p>Many of the earlier writers classified fireworks under the
    heads:&mdash;Fireworks for the ground, for the air, and for the
    water. Those falling in the latter division are only variations
    of those for the ground, that is to say, a gerb, fountain or other
    firework is fitted with a float, such as a block of wood, and
    functions floating on the surface of the water, the effect being
    greatly enhanced by the reflection.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illow62" id="i100" style="max-width: 46.5em">
    <img src="images/i100.jpg" class="w100" width="745" height="1200" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">From &ldquo;The Universal Magazine,&rdquo; 1764.</div>
  </div>

  <p>It is not proposed to deal separately in this work with
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>aquatic fireworks unless they have some essential difference
    from their parallel type for land display.</p>

  <p>One unit, of the rocket class, which is so distinct is the
    &ldquo;skimmer.&rdquo; This is in effect a stickless rocket with the cap
    (which is empty) fastened at an angle to the line of the main
    case. When fired the skimmer, as its name implies, skims over
    the surface of the water, with occasional dives under the
    surface in an erratic course. It requires for its safe display a
    considerable area of water. These are known by French
    pyrotechnists as &ldquo;<span lang="fr">genouillères</span>,&rdquo; from their shape.</p>

  <p>Ruggieri and Frézier describe what they call &ldquo;plongeons.&rdquo;
    These are gerbs charged in the ordinary way, except that
    before each scoop of composition a small quantity of mealed
    powder is added. This produces a jerky burning, the recoil
    of each puff of powder driving the gerb beneath the surface
    of the water; the jet of fire, of course, is sufficient to prevent
    water entering the case while so submerged. These, and
    other earlier writers, in their section devoted to aquatic
    fireworks, give directions for firing ordinary land fireworks
    on the water, which would almost appear to have been included
    with the idea of filling space. One item which is generally
    included consists of directions for firing rockets under
    water. Jones, under this heading, gives the following directions:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="center">&ldquo;TO FIRE SKY ROCKETS UNDER WATER.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You must have stands made as usual, only the rails must
      be placed flat, instead of edgeways, and have holes in them
      for the rocket sticks to go through; for if they were hung
      upon hooks, the motion of the water would throw them
      off: the stands being made, if the pond is deep enough,
      sink them at the sides so deep that when the rockets are in
      their heads may just appear above the surface of the water;
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>to the mouth of each rocket fix a leader which put through
      the hole with the stick; then a little above the water must
      be a board, supported by the stand, and placed along one
      side of the rockets; then the ends of the leaders are turned
      up through holes made in this board, exactly opposite the
      rockets. By this means you may fire them singly, or all at
      once. Rockets may be fired by this method, in the middle
      of a pond, by a Neptune, a swan, a water-wheel, or anything
      else you chuse.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It will be seen that the rockets themselves are above the
    surface, which seems more reasonable than the instructions of
    some writers, who, to get the effect of a rocket rising from
    actually beneath the surface, give themselves an infinite
    amount of trouble to render the case and connections waterproof.
    The effect seen from a short distance is identical.</p>

      SIMPLE FIREWORKS&mdash;SHELL CLASS</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">We</span> now come to a distinct class of fireworks, those
    whose functioning depends on the propulsion of
    gunpowder. The first and parent of this class is the
    shell or bomb.</p>

  <p>The original name of the shell was &ldquo;air balloon,&rdquo; which
    is now obsolete. Some writers have been misled by its appearance
    in old amusement announcements into thinking a balloon
    ascent was referred to, or that a balloon carrying fireworks
    was to be exhibited, at dates considerably before the invention
    of gas or hot-air balloons.</p>

  <p>In this connection it is interesting to note that Ruggieri
    claims that his father was the first to release a balloon carrying
    fireworks in 1786.</p>

  <p>As we have seen, the military use of shell dates from at
    least as early as the middle of the sixteenth century.</p>

  <p>Both Babington and Bate, writing in 1635, give instructions
    for making shell, and although the book of the former is
    more advanced in this particular matter, he is, generally
    speaking, considerably more primitive.</p>

  <p>Babington describes a hollow sphere of canvas, a part of
    which is filled with a slow-burning composition, the remainder
    being filled with stars and grain powder, the canvas is pierced
    to expose the slow composition. The shell is fired from a
    mortar having a touch-hole. The following are Babington&rsquo;s
    instructions in the matter:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Load your morter piece with one ounce of corne
      powder, putting after a wadd and tampion, and put on your
      ball with the vent towards the mouth of your piece: so
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>elevating your piece to the zenith, you may proceed to the
      firing of it, which must be after this manner: provide two
      matches ready lighted, having one in each hand, and first
      fire your ball with one hand and presently give fire to your
      piece with the other, alwaies holding your head under the
      horizontall line of your piece, for fear the blast annoy you:
      this having done you shall see your ball mount very high
      with a fair taile of fire, and when at its highest, shall break
      forth into a goodly showre of starres.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This somewhat unconvincing account gives one to wonder
    if the worthy gunner had indeed fired a shell such as he describes,
    and if so, whether he was not more than &ldquo;annoyed&rdquo;
    at the result. He gives the lifting charge as exactly one ounce,
    but gives no indication of the size of the shell or mortar. It
    seems probable that he had never seen a shell of this nature,
    and was giving his idea of it without practical experience;
    this is the more curious as, generally speaking, his book is
    wonderfully advanced for the period, and indicates personal
    experience of the matters under discussion.</p>

  <p>John Bate, although less fluent, gives greater indication of
    practical knowledge of the matter. His &ldquo;balloone&rdquo; is rather
    oblong in section, and is made by rolling canvas on a former,
    using eight or nine turns. The ends are choked in the same
    way as a rocket case, one end being choked on to a &ldquo;little
    cane rammed full of a slow composition.&rdquo; The shell is placed
    in the mortar with the fuse downwards, which is ignited by
    the flash of the mortar charge. Bate takes the precaution of
    having a time fuse at the touch-hole of the mortar, and concludes
    his instructions for firing by saying, &ldquo;and while that
    burneth, retreat out of harms way.&rdquo; Altogether a more practical
    and convincing description.</p>

  <p>Frézier (1747) makes the following prefatory remarks to
    his chapter on shells:</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;The name of &lsquo;balon&rsquo; is given to a firework which is
      thrown into the air like artillery bombs for war, so that
      they are often given the same name as bomb.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The difference between this firework and a bomb is
      not only that the former is to amuse and that the latter to
      destroy, and that the one is made of iron, and the other of
      wood, linen, or cardboard, but principally because the
      latter is made to burst and throw out its garniture at the
      point of the highest elevation, while the war bombs do so
      at the moment of their fall to the earth, also the war bombs
      are thrown towards the horizon, while the firework bombs
      are thrown vertically or nearly so.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The fireworks differ also from the war bombs in shape,
      the former being not always spherical, as the latter are.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;We must therefore understand by the name of shell a
      firework of which the effect and principal beauty is that
      while going up in the air it only shews a small stream of
      fire, which multiplies itself suddenly into a great number of
      others at the moment of its highest elevation, which causes
      a pleasant surprise.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;As this firework does not lift itself, but is thrown by
      impulsion the same way as a bomb, it can, like the latter,
      only be fired from a mortar.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He describes two shapes of shell, the spherical and cylindrical,
    with a hemispherical end, which shape is more convenient
    where the contents are long in form, as rockets, Roman
    candles, etc. He attributes the introduction of this shape to
    Siemienowitz, who, he says, made the cases of wood. He
    himself, however, adopts the modern method, as he does
    with the fuse, which he calls the port-fire. The lifting charge,
    however, is placed in the mortar separately from the shell
    and ignited at a touch-hole, in which, as will be seen, he differs
    from modern practice.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

  <p>He gives a list of garnitures or fillings, which are interesting
    as showing the practice of the day:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;The first is the one which gives the effect of a waterfall
      or head of hair. This is made of thin narrow tubes, or
      if possible, of thin canes, cut to the length of the shell, and
      filled with a slow-burning composition made of three parts
      of priming powder, two of charcoal, and one of sulphur,
      damped with a little petroleum, and capped with a paste
      made of powder crushed in distilled water or spirit and
      afterwards dried. All these are put in the tube, around the
      one which is used for the passage of the port-fire.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;When it is full the loaded port-fire is introduced, and
      pushed so far that it reaches the frame, and when it is
      touching the lid, this lid must be glued by the rough ends
      to that of the tube, and the shell is finished.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;As it is rather heavy, it is advisable to adopt means for
      its resisting the shock of the lifting charge of powder which
      drives it out of the mortar, by strengthening it with a covering
      of linen strips, which should be stuck on to the shell by
      means of a paste, composed of two-thirds of flour paste,
      and one-third of glue.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Unless this is done it often happens that the shell bursts
      before it rises in the air.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The second consists of serpents, the third of &ldquo;<span lang="fr">saucissons
    volans</span>,&rdquo; similar to the &ldquo;fiz-gig&rdquo; of Bate; the choke in the
    middle between the composition and the bang being varied in
    position so as to produce a succession of bangs. The vacant
    spaces left over in the shorter may be filled with stars.</p>

  <p>The fourth is of stars arranged in beds of grain powder;
    the interstices being filled with a mixture of mealed powder
    and charcoal. The fifth of &ldquo;light balls,&rdquo; and for the sixth he
    describes &ldquo;the manner of making figures and various shapes
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>in fire appear in the air.&rdquo; These letters are made on a frame
    covered with composition, and are consequently limited to a
    size to the internal diameter of the shell, that is, less than
    eight inches. It seems improbable that they could be distinguished
    satisfactorily at the height of a shell&rsquo;s trajectory,
    besides which the difficulties involved, as he himself explains,
    are very great, which no doubt explains the fact that this idea
    is now obsolete.</p>

  <p>Under the heading &ldquo;Double and Triple Balloons,&rdquo; this
    writer describes the method of placing shell of smaller size
    inside a larger. The bursting of the first shell lights the
    short-time fuse of the contained shell, which falls some
    distance and bursts. With the triple shell this action is
    repeated.</p>

  <p>Jones (1765) divides shell into four kinds, namely, &ldquo;illuminated
    balloons&rdquo; filled with stars; &ldquo;balloons of serpents,&rdquo;
    &ldquo;balloons of reports, marrons and crackers,&rdquo; and &ldquo;compound
    balloons.&rdquo; The last description is misleading, as the
    balloon is not compound but the contents are varied, as for
    example, the contents of one specified ten crackers of six
    reports, twenty golden rains, sixteen two-ounce cases charged
    half-inch with star composition and bounced, two ounces
    each of brilliant, blue, coloured tailed, large string and rolled
    stars. It is hard to believe that this writer had ever seen a
    shell fired in this manner, the result would have been mere
    confusion. The star compositions of that date were very
    rudimentary, the colours when seen from the distance of a
    bursting shell were indistinguishable.</p>

  <p>One interesting detail in Jones&rsquo;s work is the classification
    of sizes. The smallest shell mentioned by him is the &ldquo;Coehorn
    Balloon&rdquo;; he does not give the size, but it is given in the
    &ldquo;Military Encyclopedia&rdquo; as 4&#8532; inches. This corresponds to
    the 4&frac12;-inch of to-day. The name was apparently derived from
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>a Dutch military engineer of that name. The next size is the
    royal 5&frac12;-inch, and above that 8-inch and 10-inch.</p>

  <p>Ruggieri (1821) is the first writer on the subject to have
    the shell and lifting charge in a unit as is the practice to-day,
    which indicates constructionally a great advance over his
    predecessors, although the fillings show little progress.</p>

  <p>The modern shell is arranged with a &ldquo;lighter&rdquo; of quickmatch,
    long enough to reach from the top of the shell when
    in position in the mortar to a sufficient distance outside the
    mouth to enable it to be ignited without danger. The lighter
    fires the time-fuse in the top of the shell, and at the same time
    two pieces of quickmatch which run round the shell in grooves
    worked in the paper shell case, and ignites the lifting charge,
    which is contained in a flannel bag, or in the case of small
    shell, a paper cone.</p>

  <p>The lifting charge projects the shell into the air and the
    time fuse, which is arranged to burn through at the top of
    the shell&rsquo;s flight, ignites the bursting charge which opens
    the shell and fires the contents.</p>

  <p>The modern varieties of shell are almost infinite. Colours
    have been brought to a wonderful pitch of depth and brilliance,
    besides various kinds of fire for stars, producing stars
    with tails of the same and contrasting colours.</p>

  <p>Another class of shell, which might be called the compound,
    consists of shell filled with fireworks of other kinds&mdash;Roman
    candles, tourbillions, wheel-turning cases, small
    shell, and what gives undoubtedly the most dramatic aerial
    effect yet devised, with rockets. The &ldquo;thunderbolt,&rdquo; a shell
    16 inches in diameter, containing a hundred 4-ounce rockets,
    has always been a popular feature of the Crystal Palace displays.</p>

  <p>Another variation of the shell is the comet, which is in
    effect a small shell (generally about three inches) with an
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>exaggerated fuse of brilliant fire, which leaves a heavy tail
    during the comet&rsquo;s flight. These are usually fired from either
    side of the firing-ground in rapid succession, producing an
    aerial arch, and opening just after having passed each other.</p>

  <p>The aerial maroon consists of a maroon fitted with a
    lifting charge and time fuse.</p>

      SIMPLE FIREWORKS&mdash;MINE CLASS</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span> next group of fireworks is what may be called
    the &ldquo;Mine&rdquo; class, and has some of its members
    amongst the earliest firework units.</p>

  <p>To-day a mine consists of a quantity of small effects such
    as stars, crackers, squibs, etc., blown simultaneously from a
    case, or in display work&mdash;from a mortar. In the latter event
    they are made up into bags with the lifting charge below,
    and are known technically as &ldquo;bags.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The &ldquo;Mine of Serpents&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jack-in-the-Box&rdquo; as
    sold in the shops consist of a rolled paper case which acts as
    the mortar, at the bottom of which is a lifting charge. This
    case has a light strawboard cover with a central hole, through
    which passes a case charged with a golden fountain composition,
    the lower end of which is not&mdash;as is generally the
    case&mdash;&ldquo;clayed.&rdquo; The space round the central case is filled
    in with squibs or crackers. When lighted the fountain case
    functions in the usual way, but when finished ignites the
    lifting charge, which lights and blows up the contained fireworks.</p>

  <p>A very early reference to the &ldquo;Jack-in-the-Box&rdquo; is by John
    Babington (1635). In Chapter <abbr title="37">XXXVII</abbr> he says: &ldquo;Another
    which I call Jack in a Box. The order of making this is after
    this manner: provide a box of plate, of what largeness you
    please&mdash;then putting in a quantity of corn powder or powder
    dust (in the bottom of the box) you shall fill it with fisgigs or
    serpents, leaving a case in the middle for a cane to go through
    to the bottom, which cane must be filled with a slow receipt,
    in which you shall put a quantity of champhire but no oyles,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>in regard of the narrow passage it has to burn without any
    other vent.&rdquo; He then describes fitting the pasteboard top and
    concludes: &ldquo;and light your cane, which will appear like a
    candle, and after a pretty distance of time you shall heare a
    sudden noyse and see all those fisgigs flying some one way,
    some another. This toy has given great content to the spectators.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Frézier calls mines &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Pots à feu</span>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<span lang="fr">d&rsquo;aigrettes</span>,&rdquo; which,
    he says, were three, four, or five inches in diameter, and
    twelve to eighteen inches in length. When fired in batteries
    they were called &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Pots de brins</span>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The smaller kind were ignited at a vent formed by choking
    the case, the vent&mdash;when the case was in position&mdash;pointing
    downward. The larger sorts were lighted from above, and
    were practically the same as the Jack-in-the-Box, with the
    difference that there was a case similar to a shell fuse instead
    of the central Roman candle.</p>

  <p>Jones&rsquo; description of &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Pots d&rsquo;aigrettes</span>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Pots de
    brins</span>&rdquo; are similar, only that he fires the former with a Roman
    candle in the centre of the central mortar of a group with a
    lighter from it to each of the others, so that at the finish of
    the Roman candle the mortars are discharged simultaneously.</p>

  <p>An elaboration of the &ldquo;Jack&rdquo; is the &ldquo;Devil-among-the-Tailors,&rdquo;
    which is the same device surrounded by Roman
    candles.</p>

  <p>The next fireworks in this class&mdash;the Roman candle&mdash;is
    one whose genesis presents a most interesting study. From
    the evidence available there seems no doubt that this firework,
    in spite of its name, originated in this country.</p>

  <p>The first mention of anything resembling it is found in
    Babington&rsquo;s book. He describes what he calls &ldquo;a trunck of
    fire which shall cast forth divers fire balls.&rdquo; It is one of a
    class, apparently in favour at this time, intended to be carried
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>on a staff, and known collectively as &ldquo;fire lances&rdquo; or &ldquo;clubs&rdquo;
    (the former name is not to be confused with the lances used
    in set-piece work).</p>

  <p>The particular one under consideration, although it is
    very large, being four inches bore, and only emits two balls
    or stars, is undoubtedly the prototype of the &ldquo;Roman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bate describes a somewhat similar lance with the difference
    that &ldquo;petards&rdquo; or single crackers are substituted for
    stars.</p>

  <p>This was in 1635. Over one hundred years later, Frézier
    describes an almost exactly similar firework under the heading
    &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Artifices Portatifs</span>,&rdquo; which name he adopts instead of the
    old name &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Lance à feu</span>,&rdquo; in order to avoid confusion with
    the lance as known to-day, which was then coming into use.</p>

  <p>This is the only mention he makes of anything that can
    be considered to even remotely resemble a Roman candle,
    and as he refers to several other writers, a justifiable inference
    seems to be that neither he or they had any knowledge of
    such a firework. Had he known of it, such is its popularity
    he would certainly have mentioned it.</p>

  <p>Eighteen years later Jones describes exactly the Roman
    candle as made to-day, to which he gives the name &ldquo;Fire
    Pump.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pumps&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pumps with Starrs&rdquo; occur in the description
    subjoined to engravings depicting English peace displays
    in 1697 and 1713; there can be no doubt that the reference
    is to Roman candles or the earlier development of them.</p>

  <p>When, however, the elder Ruggieri came over to this
    country in 1749 to conduct the Aix-la-Chapelle peace display
    in Green Park, in conjunction with Sarti, no firework of this
    nature appears in the programme of the display.</p>

  <p>Here we have two pyrotechnists who can be considered
    to represent the best skill of France and Italy; in fact, it
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>was Ruggieri whose arrival in France from Italy in or about
    1735 marked the great advance in pyrotechny in the former
    country. Yet the &ldquo;Pump&rdquo; does not appear in this great display
    planned and executed by them, although for years it
    had been a popular item in displays in this country. The
    obvious reason for this omission is that they did not know of it.</p>

  <p>In the early part of the nineteenth century the name
    &ldquo;Roman candle&rdquo; comes into use both here and in France.
    The &ldquo;English Encyclopædia&rdquo; of 1802 still uses the expression
    &ldquo;Fire Pump,&rdquo; but this is probably because their article is
    copied almost verbatim from Jones&rsquo; book. The name Roman
    candle, however, appears in an advertisement of a display at
    Ipswich by William Brock in 1818, and Ruggieri the younger
    uses the words &ldquo;<span lang="fr">chandelle romaine</span>&rdquo; in his book of 1805.</p>

  <p>How this firework received the name Roman is obscure;
    it may have been affixed by one of the many Italian pyrotechnists
    working here, or it may have had political or religious
    significance.</p>

  <p>A firework functioning in the same way as a Roman candle
    is the Italian streamer, which has stars of a composition containing
    lampblack, which burn with a gold fire and leave a
    tail in their flight.</p>

  <p>The Roman candle of the present day is made with an
    almost endless variety of stars, but those in use when the name
    was first introduced were of very simple character. Coloured
    stars, as accepted to-day, were not introduced until about the
    thirtieth year of the last century.</p>

  <p>The compositions given by Jones and Ruggieri would
    produce approximately the same effect as the Italian streamer
    star of to-day, but with little or no tail.</p>

  <p>Lampblack compositions appear to have been introduced
    into Europe from the East, and there seems to be no reason
    why Italy should have had them before this country, or that
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>the introduction of lampblack into Roman candle star composition
    should be credited to Italy.</p>

  <p>It seems more probable that the name Italian streamer
    was attached to that firework in this country to distinguish it
    from the Roman candle with tailless stars, and under the
    mistaken idea that the &ldquo;Roman&rdquo; was a foreign importation,
    or that it would be more acceptable if labelled with a foreign
    name.</p>

  <p>As we have said, the modern Roman candle is made with
    stars of very many varieties, but whatever kind of star may
    be used, the method of filling is the same.</p>

  <p>The principle on which the Roman candle is constructed
    is as follows: The case is charged with a series of repetitions
    of the following&mdash;Roman candle fuse, &ldquo;dark fire,&rdquo; star, blowing
    charge. These are repeated as many times as the case will
    hold, and function thus&mdash;the fuse burns with a fountain effect,
    and upon being exhausted lights the &ldquo;dark fire,&rdquo; which lights
    the star, flashes round it and fires the blowing charge which
    propels the star from the case. The blowing charge also
    ignites the next layer of fuse, and the effect is repeated.</p>

  <p>In filling the case different sized scoops are used for the
    blowing charge, which is of fine-grain powder, the smaller
    scoops being used at the lower portion of the case. This is
    done so that the stars may rise to approximately the same
    height; the charge at the bottom acting through a greater
    distance, naturally acts more effectively and less is required.</p>

  <p>Earlier pyrotechnists, in addition, as a means of regulating
    the height of the stars&rsquo; flight, made the stars of differing sizes;
    this under modern manufacturing conditions would be impossible,
    and has been abandoned.</p>

  <p>Roman candle fuse is composed of sulphur, charcoal,
    saltpetre in the proportion of 4, 8, 15. The &ldquo;dark fire&rdquo; is of
    mealed powder, with a small admixture of charcoal.</p>

    <div class="caption">An old Firework Bill.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span></p>

  <p>Another firework which is probably a development of
    the Roman candle is the jewel fountain. This consists of a
    fountain mixture of saltpetre, sulphur, and charcoal, to which
    is added granules of star composition, which are thrown out
    by the force of the fire, giving a fountain effect in which
    appear variously coloured points of fire.</p>

      SIMPLE FIREWORKS&mdash;SAXON &amp; LANCE CLASSES</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span> fireworks which form a class by themselves are
    the Saxon or Chinese flyer, and the tourbillion. Both
    of these consist of a single case made to revolve in
    the plane of its axis by jets of fire projected through a hole at
    right angles to the axis.</p>

  <p>Saxons revolve about a nail driven through the case into
    a post or other support; they are charged with a composition
    of mealed gunpowder, saltpetre, and sulphur.</p>

  <p>The case is charged thus: the lower end is firmly &ldquo;clayed&rdquo;
    and the composition is charged up to a point about &#8541; inch
    below the centre, clay is then charged for &frac34; inch, and again
    composition to within a short distance of the top, which is
    again firmly clayed. Two holes are bored near each end on
    opposite sides of the case, and a third hole is bored through
    the centre of the case at right angles to the other two and of
    sufficient size to take the nail or spindle on which the case
    revolves.</p>

  <p>The two holes at the end may be connected with match
    to light simultaneously, or the time of burning may be lengthened
    by leading the second half from the lower end of the
    first lit. In the larger sizes, and generally in display work, a
    small case charged with a colour composition is attached to
    the side of the case, producing a ring of colour inside the fire
    of the saxon.</p>

  <p>A smaller and cheaper form of saxon is what is in effect
    half of that described above, the nail being at one end and the
    propelling hole at the other.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illow75" id="i116a" style="max-width: 56.25em">

    <div class="caption">Filling Roman Candles.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Formerly saxons for display work were made with a wooden
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>centre, on which the two halves, which were charged separately,
    were fitted, and to which the colour case was secured
    by a nail.</p>

  <p>The tourbillion is a development of the saxon; instead
    of the central spindle a piece of curved wood is secured to the
    case, forming a pivot on which to revolve when lying on a flat
    surface, and two additional holes are bored on the under side
    of the case, so arranged as to light when the case has sufficiently
    rapid revolution and project it into the air.</p>

  <p>Jones describes tourbillions as made to-day, also saxons
    under the older name of Chinese flyer. In addition, he describes
    what he calls &ldquo;table rockets,&rdquo; which resemble four double
    saxon cases fitted to a centre, which has a projecting cone
    upon which the device revolves.</p>

  <p>He says that &ldquo;table rockets are designed merely to show
    the truth of driving and the judgment of a fireworker, they
    having no other effect when fired than spinning round in the
    same place where they begin till they are burnt out, and showing
    nothing more than a horizontal circle of fire,&rdquo; but afterwards
    adds that &ldquo;these rockets may be made to rise like
    tourbillions by making the cases shorter and boring holes in
    the under side of each case at equal distances; this being
    done they are called &lsquo;double tourbillions.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Frézier shows tourbillions as at present manufactured,
    which he calls &ldquo;<span lang="fr">tourbillion de feu</span>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<span lang="fr">soleil montant</span>,&rdquo; but
    the nearest device he shows to a saxon is similar to Jones&rsquo;s
    table rocket, made to revolve on a spindle, and having several
    holes bored down the side of each case, presumably to
    produce more effect. These he designates &ldquo;tourniquets&rdquo; or
    &ldquo;<span lang="fr">soleils tournants</span>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He also illustrates two ordinary rockets mounted on a
    centre similar to that of a double saxon. This he calls &ldquo;<span lang="fr">baton
    à feu</span>,&rdquo; and describes that one case lights after the other is burnt
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>out, and one gathers that the device is intended to revolve
    but how it can be made to do this by fire issuing radially is
    not apparent.</p>

  <p>The word tourbillion is the French for a whirlwind and
    is applied by Ruggieri to a compound firework, which will
    be considered later under that head.</p>

  <p>What we know as tourbillion he names &ldquo;<span lang="fr">fusée de table</span>&rdquo;
    (a table rocket), and adds that they are commonly called
    &ldquo;<span lang="fr">artichauts</span>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The success of all the above, in common with rockets,
    depends on careful and experienced construction and strength
    of the case, and it is indeed curious that Jones describes the
    rolling of the cases for these fireworks without paste except
    on the edge of the paper. It seems incredible that an experienced
    pyrotechnist should make such a mistake, and one is
    almost inclined to agree with Kentish (1878), who says of
    Jones&rsquo;s book: &ldquo;The greater portion of it is absurd and impracticable,
    and shows it was written by a person who undertook
    to teach what he had not learnt.&rdquo; Nevertheless Jones&rsquo;s
    book, as Kentish says, has been copied by almost every book
    published since, just as his own matter was largely pirated
    from previous works. In fact, for a century and a half the
    plates illustrating pyrotechnic works were in a great degree
    fac-similes of one another.</p>

  <p>The catherine wheel, or, as it is sometimes called, the pin
    wheel, is a rotating firework of simple, as distinct from compound
    construction, and should therefore be included in this
    class.</p>

  <p>It consists of a long, thin case of small diameter, charged
    with a composition of sulphur, saltpetre, and mealed gunpowder.
    This case is wound round a circular block of thin
    wood, with a hole in the centre through which a pin or nail
    is passed, forming a pivot upon which the wheel turns.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span></p>

  <p>The case of the catherine wheel, unlike any firework we
    have considered up to the present, burns down as the composition
    is consumed, and for this reason it may be included
    equally well in another small class of fireworks. This class
    includes the lance, the port-fire, the starlights, feathers, and
    the colour cases used on wheels and saxons, etc.</p>

  <p>The lance is used in display work in greater numbers than
    any other unit. Some idea of the quantity used may be gathered
    from the fact that on one of the battle set pieces shown at the
    Crystal Palace as many as thirty thousand lances are consumed
    in a single display.</p>

  <p>Lances consist of thin paper cases about the diameter of
    a lead pencil, filled with colour composition, and primed, to
    facilitate the lighting, with mealed powder damped with water.
    This sets and further serves to retain the contents of the lance,
    which are not compressed solid as are fountains, rockets, etc.</p>

  <p>The port-fire is used as a means of lighting the pieces, etc.,
    of a display, and in the last century for military purposes;
    its composition consists of a mixture of saltpetre, sulphur,
    and mealed gunpowder. It was formerly known as a blue
    candle.</p>

  <p>The starlight and feathers, as are the squib, golden rain,
    etc., are of the garden type, and are not used in display work,
    as although burning with pretty effect, it is not distinguishable
    at any distance.</p>

  <p>The feather and starlight compositions are similar to that
    of the flower pot, but the cases are smaller, that of the feather
    being catherine wheel pipe, but naturally not bent&mdash;the ends
    are closed by &ldquo;dubbing.&rdquo; This is a method usually adopted
    for closing the ends of &ldquo;small goods.&rdquo; The end of the case is
    introduced into an opening formed by opposing V-shaped
    notches in an upper and lower series of steel plates, the upper
    set being then forced down. The result is to constrict the end
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>of the case, which is then dipped in a mixture of sealing-wax
    and glue.</p>

  <p>Under the same head fall the Light group, which are wide
    and comparatively thin cases filled with coloured or &ldquo;bright&rdquo;
    (as white composition is known in the trade) composition.
    They are used either for illuminating as Bengal lights, or for
    signalling purposes; if for the latter, they are generally provided
    with a wooden handle and some means of self-ignition.</p>

  <p>The name Bengal light is probably based on the use of
    Bengal saltpetre, and does not indicate their origin in that
    province.</p>

      COMPOUND FIREWORKS</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Compound</span> fireworks are those which are composed
    of a number of simple fireworks or units fixed to a
    framework or other device so that they produce a
    more elaborate effect than do single fireworks.</p>

  <p>Probably the earliest form of compound firework was the
    wheel. After the sky rocket had become an established fact,
    it was a small step to tie rockets round a wheel, so that when
    fired they caused it to revolve.</p>

  <p>Babington gives several devices based on the idea of imparting
    movement to a wheel by rockets: he describes horizontal
    and vertical wheels, which appear to be the same piece
    fired either horizontally or vertically. In neither case is there
    any further effect than the fire from the rockets tied to the
    periphery. His illustration shows no less than sixteen rockets
    to fire singly in succession, which would, by modern standards,
    make a rather lengthy and monotonous piece. He also
    describes ground wheels, which consist of two wheels fitted
    to an axle with a smaller wheel placed centrally between them.
    The centre wheel has rocket cases fitted to it, causing the
    whole arrangement to revolve and run along the ground. As
    an alternative he suggests substituting cases secured to the
    axle without a central wheel, so arranged that one being burnt
    out the second burns in the opposite direction and reverses
    the direction of the wheels. The device is now quite obsolete.</p>

  <p>One interesting point is the method of communicating
    fire from one case to the next; quickmatch, as used to-day,
    had not then been invented. His method was to fasten the
    cases head to tail a short distance apart by wrapping and tying
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>paper round in the form of a tube, the space so formed containing
    some mealed powder.</p>

  <p>He also describes what he calls fixed wheels, which are in
    effect the fixed sun of to-day; that is, a framework with cases
    arranged radially so that the fire is thrown out from the centre.</p>

  <p>As variations of the above, he suggests various effects such
    as &ldquo;a fixed wheel which shall give divers reports,&rdquo; &ldquo;which
    shall cast forth divers fisgigs, and likewise as many reports
    or breakers,&rdquo; &ldquo;which shall cast forth many rockets into the
    ayre.&rdquo; The latter is evidently the prototype of a piece known
    later as the rocket wheel, popular for some time, but little
    used at the present, the objection to it being that there
    is no control over the direction in which the rockets fly from
    it. The wheel revolves horizontally, and projects a series of
    rockets into the air as it revolves.</p>

  <p>During the following century, as compound fireworks
    developed in this country, the Italian and French nomenclature
    was introduced, many of which survive at the present
    time.</p>

  <p>The pyrotechnists of the eighteenth century seem to have
    delighted in inventing new terms, possibly with the idea of
    impressing the layman. Frézier, writing over a hundred years
    later than Babington, records very little advance in revolving
    fireworks, except in the matter of names. He classifies all
    revolving pieces as girandoles. This word appears in pyrotechny
    very frequently; curiously enough, nearly every writer
    has attached a different meaning to it. Frézier explains that
    the word is derived from <span lang="it">girare</span>&mdash;to revolve or gyrate, from
    the Greek.</p>

  <p>Bate applied this meaning to it. He says, &ldquo;How to make
    gironels or fire wheeles.&rdquo; He is, however, the only English
    writer to do so; others use it to mean a flight of rockets, and
    occasionally for an elaborate fixed piece of the fountain type.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

  <p>Ruggieri and Sarti, both Italians, used it in the sense of
    a &ldquo;flight&rdquo; of rockets in the programme of their Green Park
    display in 1749. Ruggieri the younger, however, applies it to a
    specific kind of revolving firework in his book, and introduces
    a new word&mdash;girande&mdash;to which he applies the same meaning
    as the one generally accepted in this country for <span lang="it">girandole</span>.
    The confusion of these two words, which have the same
    derivation, may be the explanation of the duplication of meaning,
    or it may lie in the fact that the name was also applied
    to the rocket wheel previously mentioned, which both revolves
    and throws up rockets.</p>

  <p>Frézier shows a wheel similar to that given by Babington,
    and variations on the double saxon, a fixed sun also, as do
    most early writers, double line rockets to run backwards and
    forwards and variations. These latter, which appear to have
    been very popular at this period, were known in France as
    &ldquo;courantins.&rdquo; Bate calls them &ldquo;swevels,&rdquo; other early writers
    &ldquo;runners on the line.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The above-mentioned, together with some rather intricate
    but impracticable appearing water devices, make up the
    compound fireworks in Frézier&rsquo;s book.</p>

  <p>It seems, however, that he must have been behind his day
    in this branch of the art, as the Aix-la-Chapelle peace display
    appears to have included several elaborate pieces which, even
    allowing for the usual exaggeration of the programme, must
    have required considerable skill and knowledge in construction.
    These were mostly what were called regulated or regulating
    pieces, generally described as of a certain number of
    mutations. The pieces were, and are, although the old descriptions
    are now dispensed with, so constructed that after
    being lit they go through a series of alterations in form and
    movement without further attention.</p>

  <p>Some of those described in old works would seem to have
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>required more than a slight element of luck for their successful
    performance.</p>

  <p>To-day it is often found more advantageous to make a
    second lighting in cases where there is a danger of premature
    ignition, the effect to the spectators being identical, and the
    successful functioning of the piece secured. This does not
    apply to all pieces of this nature, as with modern safety fuse
    the pyrotechnist has considerable advantage over the earlier
    practitioners.</p>

  <p>The modern spectator is only concerned with the effect
    produced, not by the means adopted to produce it. It is difficult
    to-day to realise the position occupied by the pyrotechnist
    of the eighteenth century. He carried out his work personally,
    with of course trained assistants, and occupied a position
    similar to the artist or sculptor. Each piece was looked upon
    as a work of art, the personal effort of the pyrotechnic artist.
    Ruggieri gives some idea of this in the following passage from
    his book:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;It was in the month of July, 1743, that my father and
      my uncles Ruggieri exhibited for the first time at the Theatre
      de la Comédie Italienne and before the King, the passage
      of fire from a moving to a fixed piece.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;This ingenious contrivance at first astonished the scientists
      of the day, who said when it was explained to them that
      nothing could be more simple and that any one could have
      done it at once.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He then explains the method of construction, which is to lead
    from the back end of one of the turning cases through the
    hollow centre of the axle to the lighter of the fixed piece
    situated behind it.</p>

  <p>The development of fixed and mechanical pieces was
    made possible by the introduction of quickmatch.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span></p>

  <p>When this actually took place is uncertain. Frézier describes
    its making similarly to that in use to-day, under the
    name of &ldquo;<span lang="fr">étoupilles</span>.&rdquo; Bate uses the word &ldquo;stouple,&rdquo; evidently
    a corruption of the French. He gives no actual description of
    the making of this, but it appears to be of &ldquo;cotton weeke&rdquo;
    dipped in &ldquo;aqua vitæ wherein camphire hath been dissolved.&rdquo;
    This would produce only a slow-burning match unless it was
    his intention to use it wet, in which case the burning of the
    spirits of wine might quicken the effect. It would, however,
    be quite out of the question to construct a piece of any
    elaboration with such materials.</p>

  <p>Quickmatch is manufactured to-day in the following
    manner. Cotton wick is run through a pan containing a paste
    composed of gunpowder and starch. It is wound on a frame
    six feet in length, dusted with mealed powder and dried.
    When dry it is cut off the frame and threaded into paper tubes
    or &ldquo;pipes&rdquo; of larger diameter, leaving an air space round the
    match.</p>

  <p>Before threading in the tubes it is known in the trade as
    &ldquo;raw match,&rdquo; and is used for priming and similar uses, and
    in this state will only burn quite slowly.</p>

  <p>Quickmatch is used to connect the units of all pieces.
    Display cases have a &ldquo;cap&rdquo; formed of a few turns of paper
    pasted on the case at the lighting end. When a piece is fitted
    up the cases are tied to the cleats provided to receive them on
    the framework; they are then &ldquo;lead up.&rdquo; A length of quickmatch
    has a small piece cut out of the pipe to allow the fire
    to flash through, it is then doubled at that point and inserted
    in the cap, which is gathered in and tied round securely. This
    is continued round the piece, each case having match entering
    and leaving the cap, and in some cases a further length
    connecting one series with another. This leading up of set
    pieces is work requiring skill and knowledge which is only
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>gained by experience. An amateur at a first attempt might
    possibly be successful in lighting all the cases on a piece,
    but he would be very unlikely to produce that instant
    and symmetrical ignition which denotes the skilled pyrotechnist.</p>

  <p>The smaller wheels have turning cases, that is, small
    rockets to give them motion; these burn through very rapidly,
    and the continuation of movement is provided for by capping
    the turning cases at either end and leading them up vent to
    head in series; the motive power for the larger display pieces
    is provided by gerbs, which, from the nature of their fire,
    give more effect than would rocket cases, and have the further
    advantage of burning longer.</p>

  <p>It would not be possible in the present work to give a
    complete catalogue of the varieties of pieces which have been
    produced, but the list given by Ruggieri is typical of the
    whole, and includes many of the smaller compound pieces in
    use to-day for shop and small display work.</p>

  <p>The larger display pieces are generally designed and redesigned
    season by season by pyrotechnists, and are certainly
    being elaborated and improved. They, however, fall generally
    into certain classes in the same way as do those given by
    Ruggieri. His classification is as follows:</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <ol class="inline">
      <li>Stationary fireworks.</li>
      <li>Fireworks turning vertically.</li>
      <li>Mixed fireworks or fixed and turning.</li>
      <li>Fireworks turning horizontally or on a pivot.</li>
      <li>Built-up pieces turning on a pivot.</li>
      <li>Cut-out pieces and transparencies.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">Of these, the last mentioned class are now obsolete: they
    consisted of transparent and silhouette pictures or designs
    illuminated from behind. He also includes both simple and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>compound fireworks in each class, but as the former have
    already been dealt with they will be ignored here.</p>

  <p>Class 1. (1) Glorys, fans and &ldquo;<span lang="fr">pates d&rsquo;oie</span>&rdquo; or goose
    foot, synonymous with our expression crow&rsquo;s foot.</p>

  <p>Glory was a term used also in this country to signify fixed
    suns, as mentioned above. Fans were cases five or more in
    number, arranged as the name indicated, and <span lang="fr">pates d&rsquo;oie</span>,
    three similarly arranged.</p>

  <p>(2) <span lang="fr">Mosaiques</span>. These are geometrical designs formed
    by arranging gerbs or fixt on framework, so that their fire
    forms a symmetrical pattern. The effect is heightened by
    saxons in suitable positions, and in large devices of this nature,
    small wheels, also formerly, the now obsolete fixed or five-pointed
    star.</p>

  <p>This type includes what are now called &ldquo;lattice poles,&rdquo;
    a series of poles provided with cleats so that the fire of the
    cases crosses, forming a lattice of sparks; also the more
    elaborate &ldquo;carpet piece.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>(3) <span lang="fr">Feux croisés</span>. These were similar in conception to the
    above, except that the design is circular or based on the circle
    or wheel form; this type is represented by the &ldquo;fixt piece&rdquo;
    of to-day, which is constructed up to considerable dimensions,
    the large fixt piece at the Crystal Palace often measuring
    sixty feet across the fire.</p>

  <p>(4) Palm Trees. These consist of a framework intended
    to suggest the form of a palm, provided with cleats to take
    the cases.</p>

  <p>(5) Bouquets. These he describes also as a kind of tree
    different from palm trees; his illustration shows that they
    were similar to the modern lattice-pole with the difference
    that the cleats were not symmetrically arranged.</p>

  <p>To-day the word bouquet is applied to Roman candles
    arranged in what he called &ldquo;<span lang="fr">pates d&rsquo;oie</span>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>

  <p>(6) Cascade. This device needs no explanation. He says
    that Chinese fire is the best composition for such a piece;
    this remained true up to the introduction of the aluminium
    into pyrotechny, when the &ldquo;weird white waterfall&rdquo; became
    a feature of the Crystal Palace displays, being 200 feet long
    and 90 feet high.</p>

  <p>(7) Decorations in coloured fire. This heading introduces
    the lancework set piece of to-day.</p>

  <p>The development of this branch since 1865 has been very
    marked. As will be seen from the description of the lancework
    pieces carried out at the Crystal Palace, the subjects dealt
    with have been of extraordinary variety. Up to the beginning
    of the nineteenth century pyrotechnists had failed to realise
    the possibilities of lancework. This was undoubtedly due in
    a great measure to the fewness of colours available. Ruggieri
    appears to have used lancework to outline architectural
    designs, evidently a survival of the temples or theatres of
    earlier years. In his time, and even as late as the middle of
    the nineteenth century, any subject of a pictorial nature was
    depicted by the use of scenery or transparencies. Lancework
    was, as Ruggieri describes it, merely &ldquo;decorations in coloured
    fire.&rdquo; The lances of his day were considerably thicker than
    those at present in use, which are about the diameter of a
    lead pencil. They were also spaced further apart and were in
    some cases &ldquo;bounced,&rdquo; as are fixed cases of the present day.</p>

  <p>The modern method of constructing a lancework set piece
    is as follows: An outline drawing of the subject is made in
    which all unnecessary lines are eliminated. This is ruled in
    square of such size that in the proportion one square to a foot
    the completed piece will be of the size required.</p>

  <p>Frames are then laid out on the drawing-floor: these are
    of light battens forming foot squares, and of a convenient
    size for handling, generally ten feet by five feet.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illow100" id="i128a" style="max-width: 75em">

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span></p>

  <p>The drawing is then transferred to the floor with the
    assistance of the squared lines, and the design followed by
    nailing on light wood strips or thin rattan cane.</p>

  <p>The lines thus indicated are then &ldquo;pegged,&rdquo; that is, pegs
    or small wire nails pointed at either end, are driven in at intervals
    of about four inches. The lances, whose construction
    has already been described in Chapter <abbr title="4">IV</abbr>, have their ends
    glued and are pushed on to the pegs so that they stand vertically
    from the framework. The frames are then led up with
    quickmatch, secured by pins driven into the priming. The
    match is then pierced with a small awl above the priming,
    and secured and protected by a strip of paper pasted over it
    and round the case of the lance. The piece is then ready for
    hoisting into position and firing.</p>

  <p>Formerly, and sometimes now on the Continent, the
    match was secured by a wire passing through the case near
    the top, which was twisted over the match.</p>

  <p>Ruggieri, under this head, describes a method of illuminating
    by impregnating wick similar to that used for matchmaking,
    with a mixture of sulphur, antimony, and saltpetre.
    This was wired on to a metal framework. He says it is better
    than lancework for outlining curves, volutes, etc., as the line
    is continuous. This difficulty is disposed of in modern English
    lancework by the closer spacing of lances on curves rendered
    possible by the smaller lances now used.</p>

  <p>He also remarks that this method was rarely used in his
    time and it is now quite discontinued.</p>

  <p>Another device of which he seems proud was a palm tree,
    the leaves of which were of thin metal from which project
    spikes upon which was hung cotton impregnated with a composition
    composed of &ldquo;vert-de-gris, vitriol blue and sel
    ammoniac&rdquo; (copper acetate, copper sulphate and ammonium
    chloride).</p>
  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span></p>
  <p>Immediately before firing the cotton was soaked with
    alcohol. Actually this composition can hardly be considered
    pyrotechnic; what takes place is that the alcohol burns, and
    the flame thus created is coloured with the copper present in
    the salts. The whole arrangement is too cumbersome and
    involved for modern use, but at the time of its inception, when
    colour was practically unknown, no doubt it attracted great
    admiration.</p>

      COMPOUND FIREWORKS (<i>continued</i>)</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Ruggieri&rsquo;s</span> next class (fireworks turning vertically)
    includes the following:</p>

  <p>1. Revolving Suns. These are merely vertical
    wheels; he appears to use this term for the more ambitious
    pieces of this kind.</p>

  <p>2. Vertical Wheels. He illustrates a vertical wheel exactly
    as made to-day under that name. It has, however, been
    elaborated by the addition of colour cases on the spokes and
    centre, as rosette and rainbow wheels; also by the application
    of saxons to the spokes, as saxon wheels.</p>

  <p>He also shows the triangle wheel, consisting of three spokes
    with grooved ends to receive the cases whose sides form the
    sides of an equilateral triangle. This has been further developed
    into the double triangle wheel, with two sets of spokes
    placed one set behind the other. In all the wheels in this class
    the cases fire in succession, not as in the case of the sun&mdash;simultaneously.</p>

  <p>Windmills he illustrates as flat bars pivoted in the centre
    with three cases at either end fired in succession. There also
    were three, four, and up to eight-armed windmills of the same
    kind. The nearest device to these of modern times is the
    chromatrope, the simplest form of which has two bars with a
    gerb at either end so set as to revolve them in opposite directions,
    the front one carrying two saxons. This piece, which is
    of comparatively simple design, gives an extraordinarily fine
    effect by the intersections of the various streams of fire.</p>

  <p>The chromatrope has been developed and enlarged until
    for important display work quite elaborate pieces are fired
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>under this name. Lancework of geometric form is used on
    the bars or spokes, and the intersection of these, forming ever-changing
    geometrical designs, adds greatly to the effect of the
    intersection of the fire.</p>

  <p>This effect is the basis of the <span lang="fr">Guilloché</span>, a somewhat
    elaborate piece which falls in Ruggieri&rsquo;s third class. It consisted
    of six wheels placed one behind the other in pairs of
    graduated size; the two smallest&mdash;which fired first&mdash;had six
    cases, the next eight, and the largest forty-eight, and was
    twenty feet in diameter.</p>

  <p>The next described is the <span lang="fr">Salamandre</span>, a piece which, on a
    large scale, is still occasionally fired at the Crystal Palace. It
    shows a snake in pursuit of a butterfly which it seems to overtake
    but never quite catches. The mechanism is an endless
    chain of wooden links running in and out between eight
    sprocket wheels, arranged in octagon formation. About half
    the length of the chain is made out and lanced to represent
    the snake, and a lancework butterfly is situated in the centre
    of the other half.</p>

  <p>Ruggieri claims that his father fired this piece and the
    <span lang="fr">guilloché</span> in 1739 at Versailles.</p>

  <p>The other pieces mentioned in this section are too elaborate
    for description in the space available, but are interesting as
    showing the use of the helix and spiral as applied to wheels
    and cones, as secondary elements of larger pieces.</p>

  <p>The modern designer of pyrotechnic pieces has great
    advantage over the earlier practitioners in that he has available
    an infinitely larger range of colour and other composition.
    It is often possible to get a much-enhanced result with less
    cases giving more or varied effects as opposed to a larger
    number of cases of similar effects, which, in an attempt to
    produce a lavish show of fire, end in confusion.</p>

  <p>His fourth division begins with the &ldquo;Caprice simple&rdquo;;
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>this is the modern horizontal wheel. This wheel is similar in
    arrangement to the vertical above-mentioned, except that its
    cases are arranged so that the first plays horizontally in the
    plane of the wheel, the next at an angle downwards, and the
    third upwards. This succession is repeated with the remaining
    three cases. In addition, the horizontal wheel has either a
    mine which is lit from the last case, or Roman candles and
    mine, at the centre playing upwards. The second form is
    arranged so that the Romans are fired simultaneously with
    the fourth case and the mine from the last.</p>

  <p>The wheel given by Ruggieri has a gerb in the centre. He
    explains that Caprice is a generic name applied to all horizontal
    wheels which vary the direction of the fire when revolving.
    However, at the present time the name Caprice is only applied
    to a wheel with three tiers of three cases, each similar in
    appearance to three single triangle wheels superimposed at
    distances about equal to their diameter, the grooves in the
    end of the spokes being so arranged as to vary the direction
    of the fire. The cases are led up in the following order&mdash;one
    case horizontal, one up, one down, one horizontal, two cases
    one up and one down, four cases in each direction and one
    vertical. For a compact piece this is one of the most effective
    made.</p>

  <p>A similar piece is the Furiloni Wheel, which has, however,
    two tiers of three cases each.</p>

  <p>Jones describes a furiloni wheel which is more elaborate,
    having twenty-five cases. His method of leading would, however,
    not be so effective as the modern wheels of this type.
    The cases used for these wheels are charged with a steel mixing
    formerly known as brilliant fire.</p>

  <p>He mentions two other devices&mdash;Caprices petans and Caprices
    des pâtés. The first of these was a modification of the
    piece formerly used in this country as the balloon wheel. It
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>consisted of a solid wheel round which are a series of mines
    which discharged in succession as each turning case lit. The
    second was similar but more elaborate, having rockets as well
    as mines, and was a variation of the rocket wheel.</p>

  <p>In his description of the Girandole, he explains that it is
    composed of two horizontal wheels one above the other. This
    is the form taken by the rocket wheel as fired in this country
    which, as we have seen, was known as the girandole wheel.
    Ruggieri, however, appears not to have used rockets on his
    girandole.</p>

  <p>The last device he mentions in this class is the Spirali,
    which consisted of a framework in the form of a cone, round
    which was wound a spiral of cane fitted with lances.</p>

  <p>A very effective piece, not mentioned by Ruggieri, is the
    revolving fountain; it consists of a wood centre bored to turn
    on a vertical spindle. The centre has two spokes fitted with
    gerbs for turning, and has playing vertically a large gerb and
    Roman candles. The turning gerbs play tangentially and
    slightly upwards.</p>

  <p>Jones describes a similar device under the name of &ldquo;illuminated
    spiral wheel&rdquo;; also two other horizontal pieces&mdash;the
    spirali and the plural wheels, which approximate to the furiloni
    and caprice wheels of the present day.</p>

  <p>The spiral and helix are much used in larger devices, and
    the use of modern lancework and colour has greatly added to
    their effect.</p>

  <p>Ruggieri&rsquo;s next division deals with built-up lancework
    pieces such as the globe, which it was thought worthy of
    separate mention in his time, but to-day is included with
    many devices of this nature too numerous to mention, forming,
    as they do, a large proportion of the mechanical and other
    pieces used in display work.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illow100" id="i134" style="max-width: 75em">

      Bismarck second from the left.</div>
  </div>

  <p>He then deals with tourbillions and table wheels. The
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>latter consisted of a circular table with a central pivot, round
    which is free to revolve a bar which forms the axle of a wheel,
    the hub of which runs on the edge of the table. When the
    wheel is turned, the hub running on the edge of the table
    moves it forward in a circular path round the pivot. This
    principle is applied to similar and more elaborate devices.
    The name tourbillions, as before mentioned, is by other
    writers differently applied.</p>

  <p>The section dealing with cut-out and transparent devices
    is of little interest. These devices were an attempt to give
    variety from the monotonous repetition of turning cases and
    gerbs. To-day the use of colour cases, lances, a much-enlarged
    range of fountain and similar compositions, including
    aluminium and other brilliant fires, has obviated the employment
    of effects which cannot be rightly considered as pyrotechnic.</p>

  <p>The moving and stationary pieces considered in this and
    preceding chapters give a good general idea of the firing
    methods in compound fireworks. As we have already noted,
    the difference of designs and effects at the present time is
    infinite, so that it would be impossible in a work of the present
    size to give anything approaching a complete survey of what
    has been accomplished. But it is hoped that enough has been
    said to give the reader some idea of the methods adopted and
    the lines upon which the modern pyrotechnist works.</p>

      FIREWORK COMPOSITIONS</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">It</span> may have been remarked in the foregoing chapters
    that, although the ingredients composing the firework
    mixtures are given, generally the proportions are not.</p>

  <p>The reason for this is two-fold: primarily, as we have
    seen in the chapter on rockets, the proportion of the ingredients
    of a firework varies in accordance with its size. So that
    to give the proportions of the compositions of any one type of
    firework would often require as many formulæ as there are
    sizes.</p>

  <p>Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the quality and
    purity of chemicals as supplied in bulk vary so enormously
    that a constant series of experiments has to be conducted in
    order to ascertain what modifications and adjustments are
    necessary in the formulæ to give the required standard of
    performance.</p>

  <p>It is not meant to suggest that the impurities generally to
    be found in bulk supplies are necessarily harmful to pyrotechnic
    results. This is not so; salts give far better results in
    their natural or mineral form than do those prepared synthetically.
    As an example of this saltpetre may be cited. For
    pyrotechnic purposes the best obtainable is that from Bengal,
    yet an analysis of this would probably be found to be less pure
    than that synthetically prepared in Germany. But experiments
    have shown that samples of the latter, taken from the same
    cask, but in different parts, produce very distinctly varying
    results pyrotechnically.</p>

  <p>Pyrotechny is an art, chemistry is a science, and although
    it is impossible to deny that the former is greatly indebted to
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>the latter for the supply and production on a commercial scale
    of chemical ingredients, yet it is possible to overestimate the
    position of chemistry in the art, or possibly it might be more
    correct to say that pyrotechny has its own chemistry.</p>

  <p>Chemistry without pyrotechnic experience is apt to lead
    to erroneous conclusions. To take a concrete instance: in an
    article in a famous encyclopædia, obviously written by a chemist
    of standing, a portion deals with the use of metal salts in
    the production of colour; the writer gives copper as producing
    green, which no doubt it does in the laboratory; in practice,
    however, copper is used solely for the production of blue.</p>

  <p>The question of purity in chemicals used in pyrotechny
    is a secondary consideration, that is, of course, as long as the
    adulterants have no adverse effect either as regards the pyrotechnic
    result or the safety of the worker in manipulation.
    What is of first importance is its pyrotechnic suitability, that
    is, it must produce the required result and must be consistent.
    Unequal results are the bugbear of the firework makers. As
    we have seen, constant experiments are necessary to keep an
    even standard, but with irregularly functioning chemicals
    these would be multiplied to an impossible degree.</p>

  <p>The first group of compositions for consideration is that
    nearest related to gunpowder, in fact, for the purposes of a
    work on pyrotechny, gunpowder may be considered a particular
    case of this class.</p>

  <p>The governing principle of this group, and one may say
    of all firework compositions, is the same. For combustion
    to take place oxygen must be present. When an inflammable
    article such as a piece of paper is set on fire it takes up oxygen
    from the air. A pyrotechnic composition, however, is so
    arranged that one of the ingredients has a supply of oxygen
    which it is ready to give up; another, or others, are of a kind
    ready to receive and combine with this oxygen.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span></p>

  <p>The oxygen-supplying ingredient which is by far the most
    frequently used is saltpetre, or, as it was formerly called,
    nitre, known chemically as nitrate of potash.</p>

  <p>Saltpetre may be said to be the basis of pyrotechny. There
    is hardly a formula by any of the writers on pyrotechny up to
    at least the middle of the nineteenth century which does not
    contain it.</p>

  <p>Gunpowder is composed of saltpetre, sulphur, and charcoal,
    three chemicals which it will have been gathered from
    the previous pages play a prominent part in very many of the
    pyrotechnic compositions. In some compositions their proportion
    is apparently identical with that of gunpowder, yet
    they do not form gunpowder as they are not milled, and are
    consequently not so intimately mixed. Compositions containing
    these ingredients have frequently an admixture of
    mealed gunpowder, the function of which is to give additional
    fierceness when required, as is the case in some rocket mixings.</p>

  <p>These chemicals, as we have seen in the previous chapters,
    are the components of rockets, turning cases, tourbillions,
    saxons, Roman candle fuse, and many others. When variation
    was required in fireworks used to give a simple fountain effect
    the earliest addition was of metal in finely divided particles,
    as filings, borings, or the now almost obsolete iron sand.</p>

  <p>Steel filings were used in what was known as &ldquo;brilliant
    fire,&rdquo; a term which has fallen into disuse since the introduction
    of other metals whose effects eclipsed that of steel. It has also
    been used where extra effect is wanted, that is, more tail
    in rockets and tourbillions. It is, however, not much used in
    the former case to-day, as the presence of steel in a composition
    which is to be charged on a steel spindle introduces
    a decided element of risk into the operation.</p>

  <p>The introduction of steel and iron was the first use of
    metals in firework making, probably the next metal to be
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>introduced was antimony, either black (sulphide) or regulus.
    Jones (1765) was already using what he calls crude antimony;
    this was probably the black sulphide.</p>

  <p>Before the introduction of genuine colour, and while the
    chemicals which had been adopted for pyrotechny were still
    very limited in number, attempts were made to obtain either a
    semblance of colour or some variety in stars and garnitures by
    the addition of such substances as powdered glass, brass,
    sawdust, beech raspings, which appear to have functioned as
    do the iron or steel in the compositions already discussed,
    except that there would be no coruscation even with the brass.
    These additions would merely show as red-hot particles in the
    jet of fire.</p>

  <p>Kentish gives two gerb compositions, one of which contains
    coke grains, and the other porcelain grains, which would
    apparently produce cognate results; the use, however, of
    both these ingredients is now almost if not quite obsolete.</p>

  <p>Antimony, on account of its ready combustion, is more completely
    consumed before leaving the case. In this connection it
    may be mentioned that care is necessary in a mixture containing
    steel or iron to avoid too large a proportion of the oxygen-bearing
    ingredient, for fear of consuming it inside the case.</p>

  <p>Another composition producing remarkable coruscations
    is the old-fashioned &ldquo;spur fire,&rdquo; which consists of saltpetre,
    sulphur, and lampblack. This composition requires very
    careful and experienced mixing, or no effect will be produced,
    rendering its preparation a very lengthy process.</p>

  <p>This difficulty was somewhat overcome during the last
    century by the addition of orpiment or sulphide of arsenic.
    Even with this addition, however, its manufacture requires
    care and patience. It is a curious fact that this composition,
    unlike most others, has the quality of markedly improving
    by keeping. How the lampblack produces this unique effect, or
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>why its effect should be so different from that produced by any
    other form of carbon, has not been satisfactorily explained.</p>

  <p>The compositions we have been considering fall into one
    of two classes, namely, those to produce force and those to
    produce sparks. These two classes, with one other, namely
    that of colour, may be said to include all the modern recreative
    firework compositions. Up to the end of the eighteenth
    century the ingredients used in the production of the compositions
    of these three classes were very few in number. A
    considerably larger number went to supply the ingredients
    for a fourth class now almost extinct, these might be called
    the flame-producing class. The principle on which these compositions
    were designed was, as it were, to overload a mixture
    of saltpetre and sulphur with combustible material; this
    latter took the form of gums, resins, or fats, the object being
    to produce a reddish or golden coloured flame. The early
    writers give formulæ for variously coloured stars and fires,
    which must have required considerable effort on the part of the
    observer for identification. These belonged to the flame class.</p>

  <p>Frézier, with more perception than most of the others,
    realised the shortcomings of such compositions, merely
    designating them greenish (<i lang="fr">verdâtre</i>), yellowish, reddish, and
    russet. The only colour which he professes to produce distinct
    is blue, which he obtained with pure sulphur.</p>

  <p>Progress from the earliest times of pyrotechny up to the
    first quarter of the nineteenth century was very gradual and
    very slight. The chemicals used by Bate and Babington in
    their actual pyrotechnic compositions were as follows:&mdash;Gunpowder
    and its constituents, camphor, pitch, resin, orpiment,
    linseed oil, both pure and boiled, oil of spike (<i>spica
    lavandula</i>), oil of petre (rock oil), an oil known either as
    benedict or tile, varnish (probably amber), iron scales, and
    aqua vitæ (spirits of wine).</p>

  <div class="figcenter illow68" id="i140" style="max-width: 50.875em">
    <img src="images/i140.jpg" class="w100" width="814" height="1200" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Diagram Illustrating the evolution of Pyrotechnic Composition.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span></p>

  <p>Bate extends this list considerably by the ingredients of a
    series of compositions which he has evidently taken from
    some alchemistic work. These compositions are all either
    designed to burn under water or to ignite spontaneously in
    water, and fall somewhat outside the bounds of our subject.
    Frézier also includes these, evidently from the same source.</p>

  <p>Bate also refers to a liquid, the recipe for which was probably
    taken from the same work.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<span lang="la">Aqua ardens</span>.&rdquo; The following are his directions for preparing
    it: &ldquo;Take old red wine, put it into a glassed vessell,
    and put into it of orpiment one pound, quicke sulphur halfe a
    pound, quicke lime a quarter of a pound; mingle them very
    well, and afterwards distill them in a rosewater still; a cloth
    being wet in this water will burne like a candle and will not
    be quenched with water.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It is difficult to see what he obtained by this process differing
    from spirits of wine. The quicklime would serve to dehydrate
    the wine, and probably no part of the orpiment or sulphur
    would be taken over in the distillation.</p>

  <p>Rather over a century later we find Frézier and Jones have
    made some additions to the ingredients of pyrotechny, the
    most notable innovations being the use of iron filings (not to
    be confused with the iron scales of Bate, which were probably
    hammerslag, the magnetic oxide of iron), steel filings and
    pulverised cast-iron. Beyond these, and the spark-producing
    agent already mentioned, the other additions are of small
    importance, the most notable being lapis caliminaris, or the
    mineral carbonate of zinc, which however was not used as are
    metal salts to-day, that is, for the production of colour.</p>

  <p>Jones&rsquo;s book, written some years after that of Frézier,
    shows little advance from the latter as far as pyrotechnic
    results are concerned. What he has done, however, is to
    eliminate what might be called the alchemistic, or one
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>might almost say magic element with which it is pervaded.</p>

  <p>In attempting to classify the compositions in Frézier&rsquo;s book
    one is staggered by the grotesque character of many of them and
    by the extraordinary variations in the proportion of their ingredients,
    even amongst compositions designed for a similar effect.</p>

  <p>Presumably with the intention of impressing his readers
    with the wonders of the science, he added ingredient after
    ingredient, which, if they did actually no harm to the composition,
    certainly in no degree assisted its functioning.</p>

  <p>In what he calls a simple star there are eleven ingredients,
    of which, in fact, four only are essential.</p>

  <p>Further, beyond the multiplication of unnecessary ingredients
    in individual compositions, there is often their
    incompatibility and innate unsuitability for the purpose. Such
    components as ink, onion juice, and the drainings of a dung-heap
    suggest so strangely the formulæ of the alchemists that
    one almost expects to come across &ldquo;the hair of a Barbary
    ape,&rdquo; or similar absurdity.</p>

  <p>Ruggieri, who may be considered as the last of the old
    school, is the first author to deal with the subject in such a way
    as to convince the professional reader of the practical knowledge
    of the subject.</p>

  <p>His additions to the list of ingredients are not many, but
    they are genuine. He is the first writer to make use of metals
    or their salts in the production of colour; he includes among
    his chemicals metallic copper and zinc, also the acetate and
    sulphate of copper, and chloride of ammonium. The notable
    advance in his colour compositions, besides the use of metal
    salts for that purpose, is the introduction of a chloride, which
    has the effect of improving the colour by assisting in the
    volatilisation of the metal. For this purpose he used sal-ammoniac,
    the use of which has now been almost discontinued on
    account of its hygroscopic nature, notwithstanding that its
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>base of ammonium is very useful in compositions containing
    copper. Its place is now generally taken by calomel; in such
    compositions chloride of sodium had been used for many
    years, but not as a chlorine carried. Ruggieri appears to have
    been the first to produce colour on anything approaching
    modern lines, and although he did not progress greatly, what
    he did achieve was undoubtedly a marked advance in the art.</p>

  <p>His account of the invention of this composition is interesting.
    He says that he was told by a returned traveller from
    Russia of a set piece representing a palm tree, &ldquo;the colour of
    which rivalled nature.&rdquo; This piece he set out to imitate, which
    he did, at any rate to his own satisfaction. The result he
    obtained would undoubtedly give a good colour, if the method
    of firing was very clumsy. He remarks that he does not know
    if his method was as that adopted in Russia, and later of the
    &ldquo;merit if not of discovering a new fire at least to have imitated
    or rather to have rediscovered it.&rdquo; It appears, therefore, that
    there may be some doubt as to the originality or priority of
    Ruggieri&rsquo;s achievement in this direction, but he must be
    credited at least with independently arriving at the result.
    Indeed it is more than probable that the piece seen in Russia
    was quite different, a transparency or illumination, either
    imported or copied from the work of Eastern pyrotechnists,
    and that the whole credit of introducing colour into the art
    belongs to Ruggieri and to him only.</p>

  <p>He mentions that he puts it on record with the object of
    &ldquo;thus preventing writers from attributing it to the Chinese,
    the Medes, or Arabs, as is the custom in Europe, and above
    all in France, where more than elsewhere there is a mania for
    enriching foreigners with our merits and to rob ourselves of
    the birthrights of genius.&rdquo;</p>

      MODERN FIREWORK COMPOSITIONS</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Ruggieri</span> may be regarded as the last of the ancients.
    It is true that his book shows a marked advance on anything
    that had gone before, also that he appears to have
    been one of the first, if not actually the first, to introduce the
    use of metal salts in the production of colour. But he makes
    no reference to the use of chlorate of potash, and it is the introduction
    of this salt into pyrotechny which marks the commencement
    of the modern epoch of the art.</p>

  <p>This earliest use of chlorate, or as it was then called, oxymuriate
    or hyperoxymuriate of potash, appears to have been
    soon after its discovery in 1786 by Berthollet. Samuel Parkes,
    in a work on chemistry written in 1811, says: &ldquo;The shocking
    death of two individuals in October, 1788, and the burns
    others have suffered by it, render it feared by chemists in
    general,&rdquo; that is in conjunction with sulphur and charcoal.</p>

  <p>He later remarks that notwithstanding this accident &ldquo;the
    French have since &mdash;&mdash; actually employed in one of their campaigns
    gunpowder made with oxymuriate of potash instead
    of saltpetre,&rdquo; and adds that a Scotch clergyman had taken
    out a patent for the use of a powder containing chlorate of
    potash to be fired by percussion.</p>

  <p>This patent, granted in 1807, is the first for the percussion
    system in firearms.</p>

  <p>The use, however, of chlorate of potash in propellant compositions
    presents no very great advance in pyrotechny,
    however revolutionary may have been the introduction of
    the percussion system into the manufacture of firearms.</p>

  <p>It is its use in the production of colour that marks the
    modern epoch.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span></p>

  <p>The exact date of this innovation appears to be about 1830.</p>

  <p>A Belgian lieutenant of artillery, Hippert by name, published
    in 1836 a translation of a work by Captain Moritz Meyer,
    of the Prussian Artillery, on the application of chemistry to
    artifices of war.</p>

  <p>In a chapter devoted to coloured fires he gives several
    formulæ containing chlorate of potash. Although this appears
    to be the first published notice of its use, it seems likely that
    by the time the book was published that it was fairly well
    established.</p>

  <p>Meyer concludes his remarks on coloured composition
    by saying that the English at that time made use of coloured
    rockets for signalling at sea, and had succeeded in producing
    ten different shades, &ldquo;which are quite sufficient for the purpose
    of signalling particular pieces of information.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This seems rather to indicate that the elaboration if not
    the first introduction of chlorate of potash into pyrotechny
    may be attributed to this country.</p>

  <p>His mention of ten distinguishable tints, however, is
    somewhat optimistic. During the late war it was found that
    to avoid any chance of a mistake in code signals only three
    colours could be used for long-distance signalling, namely,
    red, green, and white.</p>

  <p>It is curious that Meyer makes a mistake over the first
    composition he mentions. He describes a light composition
    of chlorate of potash and sugar, which he says burns with a
    red light. In fact, however, the light so produced is a bluish
    white, similar to the so-called blue shipping light.</p>

  <p>The directions he gives for the preparation of other colours
    are as follows:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A powder which burns with a green flame is obtained
    by the addition of nitrate of baryta to chlorate of potash, nitrate
    of copper, acetate of copper.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

  <p>&ldquo;A white flame is made by the addition of sulphide of
    antimony, sulphide of arsenic, camphor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Red by the mixture of lampblack, coal, bone ash, mineral
    oxide of iron, nitrate of strontia, pumice stone, mica, oxide of
    cobalt.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Blue with ivory, bismuth, alum, zinc, copper sulphate
    purified of its sea water (<i>sic</i>).</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yellow by amber, carbonate of soda, sulphate of soda,
    cinnabar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is necessary in order to make the colours come out
    well to animate the combustion by adding chlorate of potash.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>These formulæ, if somewhat incoherent, and clearly showing
    a want of experimental verification, indicate a real advance
    in pyrotechnic chemistry, not only by the addition of chlorate
    of potash, but by the multiplication of the number of metal
    salts used.</p>

  <p>At the same time it is evident that the old alchemistic ideas
    were not entirely extinct by the use of such ingredients as
    ivory, mica, and pumice stone.</p>

  <p>However, there can be no doubt that from the third decade
    of the nineteenth century dates the modern era of the pyrotechnic
    art. From this date onward chemical ingredients,
    metals and their salts as they were provided by the commercial
    chemist were eagerly taken and tested by the pyrotechnist, and
    adopted or rejected on their merits. And from this date begins
    the rapid elimination of useless additions.</p>

  <p>Of those compositions given above the following salts are
    at present in use: nitrate of baryta, sulphide of antimony,
    sulphide of arsenic, nitrate of strontia, copper sulphate, carbonate
    of soda, and chlorate of potash.</p>

  <p>Zinc, alum, lampblack, and oxide of iron are also used,
    but not for the purpose indicated.</p>

  <p>Nitrate of copper and sulphate of soda would both be
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>valuable ingredients, but their unstable nature prevents their
    use under modern conditions.</p>

  <p>Meyer also describes the use of salts to tint an alcohol
    flame, which is merely an elaboration of Ruggieri&rsquo;s palm tree
    and of little interest at the present time.</p>

  <p>The next name prominent in pyrotechny is that of
    F. M. Chertier, who published in 1854 his &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Nouvelles
    recherches sur les feux d&rsquo;artifice</span>,&rdquo; after having published
    a pamphlet on the subject about twenty-five years previously.</p>

  <p>In this work Chertier devotes most of his attention to the
    subject of colour, and although new ingredients have been
    introduced which were either unknown or were not then
    available on account of expense or other causes, since the
    time of his writing, yet there can be no doubt that Chertier
    stands alone in the literature of pyrotechny and as a pioneer
    of the modern development of the art.</p>

  <p>Tessier, in the introduction to his &ldquo;Treatise on Coloured
    Fires,&rdquo; published in 1859, whilst paying tribute to Chertier&rsquo;s
    work, regrets that he only possessed &ldquo;quite superficial notions
    of chemistry.&rdquo; Here speaks the chemist. The writer recently
    asked a pyrotechnic chemist of many years&rsquo; experience, whose
    knowledge of pyrotechnic chemistry is probably second to
    none, his opinion of Tessier&rsquo;s book, and received this answer.
    &ldquo;Tessier&rsquo;s book contains too much chemical theory and too
    little pyrotechnic practice.&rdquo; There speaks the pyrotechnist.</p>

  <p>The writer, as he has before remarked, has no wish to
    belittle the value of the chemist&rsquo;s work in relation to pyrotechny,
    but a knowledge of chemistry is not the most important
    attribute of the successful pyrotechnist.</p>

  <p>As in other arts so in pyrotechny, experience and natural
    aptitude are the first essentials.</p>

  <p>Chertier may have had little knowledge of chemistry, but
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>in spite of or perhaps because of his lack of chemical knowledge,
    he was able to produce a work which, from the point
    of view of the practical pyrotechnist, has never been equalled.</p>

  <p>His researches were conducted by practical experiments;
    he had one end in view, namely, pyrotechnic effect, and by
    exhaustive trials of the materials obtainable, unbiased by
    theoretical consideration, he succeeded in advancing the art
    to a stage undreamed of a few years previously. It is true that
    many of his formulæ are not in use to-day, in this country
    that is, on account of the danger of using sulphur or sulphur
    compounds in conjunction with chlorate of potash; but
    there can be no doubt that his writings and research work
    laid the foundation of modern pyrotechnic practice.</p>

  <p>Once the theory of colour production was established,
    that is to say the volatilisation of a metal salt in a hotly burning
    composition, it was a matter of less difficulty to either
    eliminate the sulphur, which was present chiefly as a burnable,
    or to replace it.</p>

  <p>This prohibition, as we have seen, took place in 1894,
    under Order in Council 15, and affected the production of
    coloured fireworks far less than might have been anticipated.
    During the period between the introduction of chlorate of
    potash and the Order in question, the development of commercial
    chemistry had increased greatly the number of
    chemicals available in pyrotechny, so that in some few cases
    it was found possible to replace the chlorate.</p>

  <p>In addition, moreover, most of the leading makers, anticipating
    some form of restriction on this admixture, had been
    for some time previously seeking substitute colour formulæ,
    and although it may be said by some that colours were obtained
    by the use of chlorate and sulphur which have not been
    equalled by subsequent formulæ, yet most have not only
    been equalled but improved upon, and the small minority
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>remaining are an insignificant price to pay for the security
    and safety gained in manufacture.</p>

  <p>Between the publication of Chertier&rsquo;s book in 1856 (nearly
    thirty years later than his first pamphlet) and the close of the
    century, several works on pyrotechny made their appearance,
    several by Frenchmen: Tessier, 1859, &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Traité Pratique des
    Feux colorés</span>,&rdquo; two works in the Roret encyclop&aelig;dia series,
    &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Pyrotechnie Civile</span>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Pyrotechnie Militaire</span>,&rdquo; published
    1865, and in 1882, &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Traité pratique des Feux d&rsquo;Artifice</span>,&rdquo;
    by Denisse.</p>

  <p>The English works of any value during this period were:
    &ldquo;Pyrotechny,&rdquo; by Practicus, Brown&rsquo;s &ldquo;Practical Firework
    Making,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Pyrotechnist&rsquo;s Treasury,&rdquo; by Kentish,
    1878. Hutstein and Websky&rsquo;s &ldquo;Art of Firework Making,&rdquo;
    published at Leipzig in 1878, a book published under the
    same title by Oscar Frey about 1885, and &ldquo;A Theoretical
    and Practical Treatise of Civil Pyrotechny,&rdquo; by Antoni,
    published at Trieste in 1893, together with some works on
    military pyrotechny published both in Europe and the United
    States, complete the list.</p>

  <p>Some of the military works are of considerable value, but
    are chiefly directed to the study of rockets and signals; some,
    however, are in the same category as &ldquo;The Artillerist&rsquo;s Manual
    and British Soldier&rsquo;s Compendium,&rdquo; by Captain F. A.
    Griffiths, R.A., published in 1852. The section dealing with
    fireworks in this work might almost be taken as an attempt
    to be humorous on the subject. The author quotes in all
    seriousness formulæ dating from the days of Bate and Babington,
    and knows so little of his subject that he gives instructions
    for making the same firework under different names
    under the impression that they are distinct units, the information
    being obviously pillaged from earlier writers.
    Generally a study of the above-mentioned works indicates
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>that the tendency in pyrotechnic compositions has been in
    the direction of simplification. During the eighteenth century
    the useless ingredients had been in a great measure eliminated.
    The &ldquo;burnables&rdquo; had been reduced from a long list of
    alchemistic survivals to a mere half-dozen or so.</p>

  <p>Gums had been reduced practically to shellac alone (the
    use of gum arabic as an adhesive is quite distinct), carbons to
    lampblack and charcoal, and these with sulphur and sulphides
    of antimony and arsenic practically completed the list.</p>

  <p>Of the metals the use of pure zinc, copper, and brass has
    been discontinued, and the two almost revolutionary additions
    of magnesium and aluminium made, the former about 1865
    and the latter in 1894.</p>

  <p>The date of the introduction of these metals marks almost
    as great advances in the art as did the introduction of chlorate
    of potash. Not only are they used as spark-producing metals
    in the same way as are steel and iron, but they are also used
    as &ldquo;burnables,&rdquo; that is, they are consumed inside the case;
    and many of the present-day firework compositions owe their
    brilliance to one or other of these metals.</p>

  <p>It is, however, in colour compositions that the tendency
    towards simplification is most strongly exhibited. In
    Kentish&rsquo;s book colour compositions containing as many as
    seven or eight ingredients are common, whereas to-day
    formulæ containing over four are the exception rather than
    the rule.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illow100" id="i150" style="max-width: 75em">
    <img src="images/i150.jpg" class="w100" width="1200" height="964" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Roman Candles. This untouched photograph illustrates the extraordinary brilliance of aluminium compositions.
      Each &ldquo;plume&rdquo; (200 ft. high) is produced by a single star about &frac34; in. diameter and &frac34; in. long.
      Each line is a microscopic particle of aluminium.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The reason for this complexity is not easy to follow, but
    it may have been in some measure due to the difficulty of
    obtaining sufficiently finely ground chemicals before the days
    of machine grinding; in some cases it was found that by melting
    two of the ingredients together and allowing the mass to
    cool they could be ground with greater ease. Chertier went
    so far as to melt shellac and salt together, grind them and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>remove the salt by dissolving in water. Also by adding a finely
    ground chemical of similar action to one only coarsely ground
    a better result was obtained.</p>

  <p>Whatever may have been the reason, there can be no doubt
    that, except for secondary shades, the fewer the chemicals used
    the more brilliant will be the resulting fire.</p>

      MILITARY PYROTECHNY</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span> use of pyrotechnic mixtures for military purposes
    is the basis of artillery, and one might almost say the
    foundation of chemistry. Before the age of the alchemist
    men were at work endeavouring to produce some
    weapon which would give them an advantage over their
    enemies. Of the natural phenomena none made so strong an
    appeal as fire, which from earliest times had been a mysterious
    and therefore terrible element.</p>

  <p>The early use of fire or pyrotechnic mixtures gave the
    users so decided an advantage over their enemies that their
    use was chronicled by historians of the day either on the side
    of the victors as a pæan of praise for their invincible weapon,
    or as an excuse for defeat on the side of the vanquished.</p>

  <p>Such reports are necessarily vague and exaggerated, vague
    because the writer had no technical knowledge of the subject,
    and the users naturally wished for secrecy and exaggerated
    because exaggeration increased the value of the weapon.</p>

  <p>It is from such reports that we obtain our information
    about Greek fire and similar compositions, and when one
    considers that the translations were generally biased, in most
    cases unintentionally but still biased, in favour of reading
    into passages referring to fire or projectiles an early reference
    to gunpowder, guns or some unknown pyrotechnic effect, it
    is obvious that all information so gained must be accepted
    with a considerable amount of reserve.</p>

  <p>The translators, too, in many cases were men of no technical
    knowledge, which made them even more prone to fall
    into errors which would be avoided by the expert.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span></p>

  <p>Of the mass of writing dealing with the subject, the work
    of two writers stands out prominently&mdash;the late Mr. Oscar
    Guttman in his &ldquo;History of Explosives,&rdquo; and <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> H. W. L.
    Hime in his &ldquo;Origin of Artillery,&rdquo; whose observations
    cover the field of information on the subject, although approaching
    from slightly different angles.</p>

  <p>Neither, however, gives an exact explanation satisfactorily
    covering the projection of Greek or sea fire. <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Hime,
    rejecting earlier theories, goes somewhat to the other extreme:
    he denies the knowledge of saltpetre before the twelfth century,
    but attempts to explain the phenomenon by the use of
    phosphide of calcium.</p>

  <p>He premises four conditions to be filled by the weapon
    or apparatus. These conditions are fulfilled by the explanation
    already briefly touched upon on page 15, and the writer is
    convinced that this simple although apparently little known
    phenomenon is the true explanation of the terrible, mysterious
    Greek or sea fire.</p>

  <p>If a mixture of saltpetre, pitch, and sulphur is charged
    into a long tube sufficiently strong and ignited it will burn,
    giving off dense smoke, for a short time, when it appears to
    choke momentarily. This choking is followed by a more or
    less violent outburst, which may be likened to a &ldquo;cough,&rdquo;
    projecting a burning mass of composition to a considerable
    distance; the action is repeated with surprising regularity
    during the burning of the whole of the composition throughout
    the length of the tube, and will, the writer is confident,
    satisfy any unbiased observer that here is the true explanation
    of the phenomenon.</p>

  <p>Let us see how the requirements mentioned by <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Hime
    are fulfilled. The first, &ldquo;It was a wet fire,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, its action
    necessarily connected in some way with water or the sea,
    and as a matter of fact it was used at sea with great success
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>on many occasions. May not a &ldquo;wet fire&rdquo; be a way of saying
    &ldquo;a molten, viscous mass of fire&rdquo;? The masses would float and
    although some might become extinguished, some would
    probably burn on the surface of the water; also its use at sea
    would, with a range up to a hundred yards, be quite as easy as
    on land.</p>

  <p>Secondly, &ldquo;Its composition was such as could be kept
    secret at Constantinople.&rdquo; If, as <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Hime says, saltpetre as
    such was unknown at the time, it was only as a separate kind
    of salt. It was undoubtedly known, but not distinguished from
    sea salt or nitrate of soda. Would not this fact render the concealment
    of the ingredients used more easy?</p>

  <p>Thirdly, &ldquo;It burned with much noise and smoke.&rdquo;
    Allowing for some slight exaggeration the first condition is
    fulfilled, as undoubtedly is the latter.</p>

  <p>Fourthly, &ldquo;It was necessarily connected in some way
    with syphons.&rdquo; As <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Hime points out, there is ambiguity
    between the word syphon and tube, and if the latter word
    meets the facts it seems the more likely rendering.</p>

  <p>The writer saw this effect produced during experiments
    with smoke-producing compositions, and it is probable that
    the mixture in question was not in the most effective proportions,
    but so striking was the result that there is little doubt
    that experiments on such lines would produce a terrible and
    effective weapon under the conditions of warfare then in
    existence.</p>

  <p>The &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Dictionnaire Mobilier Français</span>&rdquo; gives a diagram of
    a weapon of a somewhat similar nature stated to have been
    used by the Arabs in the fifteenth century. The illustration
    shows what is virtually a Roman candle, and appears plausible
    until one considers the facts. What is most probable is
    that the weapon, which was of an incendiary nature, was
    similar to that described above, which fulfils the requirements
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>of the description without assuming a knowledge of compositions
    which at the time did not exist.</p>

  <p>From the period of Greek fire onward military and recreative
    pyrotechny appear to have marched side by side.</p>

  <p>As we have seen, the progress in the latter branch was
    extremely slow, so with the former, and it was not until the
    introduction of modern or comparatively modern methods
    that real progress commenced.</p>

  <p>With the progress came divergence, the introduction of
    the rifled bore in artillery, and of nitro compounds and high
    explosives whose dynamic force exceeds many times that of
    gunpowder, which however useful they might be to the
    artillerist, were of little value to the recreative pyrotechnist.
    It was not until the great war that the resources of pyrotechny
    were fully realised and utilised by the military. It is curious
    to note that just as the tactics and methods of warfare eventually
    adopted&mdash;although on an unprecedentedly large scale&mdash;were
    in a great measure those of centuries before, so military
    pyrotechny returned to ideas just as antiquated. With the
    advantages of modern science, and by the assistance of knowledge
    gained in the development of recreative pyrotechny,
    the progress made in a month or so in military pyrotechny
    during the war may, without exaggerating, be said to have
    exceeded that of previous centuries.</p>

  <p>Speaking generally, the use of pyrotechny in warfare, or
    indeed any science, has two objectives, the first to destroy or
    embarrass the troops of the enemy, and secondly, to assist
    one&rsquo;s own.</p>

  <p>Until the late war it was the first of these which received
    by far the greater attention, and it is but natural that the introduction
    of the modern methods mentioned above should
    have provided means which left pyrotechnics far behind. In
    the second division, however, pyrotechny triumphed.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span></p>

  <p>Of the offensive type the earliest use of pyrotechny was
    the incendiary. Greek fire, wild fire, and similar compositions
    have been used from time immemorial to set fire to enemies&rsquo;
    works or ships or to injure his personnel. And just as incendiary
    compositions antedated the propellant, so the incendiary
    shell appears to have preceded the explosive.</p>

  <p>Incendiary projectiles of the past were known as carcasses;
    the earliest form appears to have been a canvas bag or container
    pitched over on the outside and bound with iron hoops,
    which, from their likeness to the ribs of a corpse&mdash;according
    to &ldquo;Chambers&rsquo; Encyclopædia&rdquo; (1741)&mdash;suggested the name.</p>

  <p>The fireball was similarly constructed and designed for
    hand projection, bearing the same relation to the carcass as
    does the grenade to the bomb.</p>

  <p>The composition in most incendiary missiles consisted
    of a mixture of saltpetre, sulphur, and pitch, with or without
    the addition of mealed gunpowder.</p>

  <p>The most recent form of carcass was a spherical shell of
    iron, having three vents, and filled with incendiary composition.
    This projectile became obsolete in the Service at the
    end of the last century.</p>

  <p>Another form of pyrotechnic projectile was that designed
    to give out smoke, either with the idea of rendering the
    atmosphere of works or casemates unbearable to the defenders
    (a principle revived in the late war by the use of poison gas),
    or to hinder them by obscuring their vision either by firing a
    smoke cloud in their (the enemy&rsquo;s) works, or so placed as to
    hide one&rsquo;s own troops.</p>

  <p>It is open to discussion if the use of smoke is not indeed
    of greater antiquity than that of incendiary missiles, but it is
    probable that its origin was its production by the combustion
    of grass or similar material, and not with pyrotechnic composition.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>

  <p>Read&rsquo;s &ldquo;Weekly Journal&rdquo; of October 25th, 1760, in an
    account of a review in Hyde Park, mentions as the concluding
    item of the man&oelig;uvres, that &ldquo;pieces of a new construction, of a
    globular form, were set on fire, which occasioned such a smoke
    as to render all persons within a considerable distance entirely
    invisible, and thereby the better in time of action to secure a
    retreat.&rdquo; There can be little doubt that this is one of the first
    demonstrations, at any rate in this country, of the use of
    smoke balls.</p>

  <p>The Chinese made use of both projectiles many centuries
    ago, and the smoke&mdash;or stink-pot&mdash;was in use by them until
    comparatively recently.</p>

  <p>Smoke balls from 4&#8534;th inches up to 13 inches calibre
    were included in the official list of projectiles for smooth-bore
    guns until about 1873, when with ground light balls they
    became obsolete. The latter, as their name suggests, were
    intended to be burnt on the ground and light up enemy
    working parties, etc. This also was the object of the parachute
    light-ball, which was fitted with a time fuse and an opening
    charge; upon opening, a light was ignited suspended from a
    parachute. This method appears to have been invented in
    Denmark in 1820, and they were used in Austria the following
    year.</p>

  <p>Another class of war store which naturally suggests itself
    is that used to give light for the purpose of signalling. The
    light is either burnt on the ground as a hand light or fitted to
    a rocket. Fireworks for this purpose have been in use from
    earliest times, being the logical development of the signal
    beacon, but it was not until the introduction of genuine
    colour&mdash;that is to say, colour distinguishable at a long distance&mdash;that
    they reached their full standard of utility.</p>

  <p>It is, however, the rocket which has received most attention
    for military purposes, and certainly with good reason. Here
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>was a projectile which, in the days of smooth-bore ordnance
    had a good range and required no heavy gun or transport.
    Moreover, it formed its own time fuse. Congreve wrote:
    &ldquo;Rockets are ammunition without ordnance, the soul of
    artillery without the body.&rdquo; Many methods of fitting up
    rockets for warlike purposes have been evolved, invented
    and re-invented, most of which for practical purposes were
    useless.</p>

  <p>It is the military use of the rocket, however, which presents
    the most interesting study in military pyrotechny.</p>

  <p>There are several early references to what is supposed to
    be the use of rockets in warfare. The Paduans are stated to
    have burned the town of Mestre with these projectiles.</p>

  <p>Orleans used rockets in its defence in 1429, and Dunois
    fired them in 1449, when besieging the town of Pont-Andemer.
    In 1452 they were used against Bordeaux, and the following
    year at Gand.</p>

  <p>Rockets were employed in 1586 for lighting purposes and
    as projectiles against cavalry. The description seems to indicate
    a method of fitting up to produce a similar effect to a
    shrapnel shell.</p>

  <p>Hanselet, writing in 1630, refers to rockets with grenades
    attached. Casimir Siemienowitz, <abbr title="Lieutenant-General">Lieut.-General</abbr> of the Ordnance
    to the King of Poland, published in 1650 his &ldquo;Great
    Art of Artillery,&rdquo; which contains a treatise on fireworks both
    for civil and military purposes. He refers to a work on the
    military use of fireworks written ninety years before, and
    speaks of rockets up to 100 lbs. and describes their construction.</p>

  <p>A French work published in 1561, entitled &ldquo;Treatise
    upon several kinds of War-Fireworks,&rdquo; suggests a rocket case
    of varnished leather.</p>

  <p>It is on record that in 1688 trials were made in Berlin
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>with rockets of 50 lbs. and 120 lbs., which carried a bomb
    weighing 16 lbs. The composition was nine parts saltpetre,
    four parts sulphur, and three parts charcoal. The case is stated
    to have been of wood covered with linen.</p>

  <p>Hyder Ali is credited with making considerable use of
    rockets against our troops in India; he is said to have had a
    corps of 1,200 &ldquo;rocketers&rdquo; in 1788, whilst later on, his son,
    Tippoo Sahib, employed as many as 5,000, and Captain
    Moritz Myer, writing in 1836, ascribes to experience of these
    weapons so gained the efforts made in England to bring them
    to perfection.</p>

  <p>He also describes the Indian rocket as &ldquo;an iron envelope
    about 8 inches long and 1&frac12; inches in diameter, with sharp
    points at the top. The stick of bamboo 8 or 10 feet long, but
    sometimes consisting of an iron rod. They were hand-thrown
    by the rocketers, and did much damage to the cavalry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This description, which, to say the least, is unconvincing,
    would seem rather to refer to some other pyrotechnic missile.</p>

  <p>Whatever may have been the cause, there was undoubtedly
    great interest in the subject of rockets during the first half of
    the nineteenth century. Sir William Congreve is perhaps best
    known in connection with the work of this period. His efforts,
    however, were rather directed to the development of existing
    ideas than to invention.</p>

  <p>In 1804, after experiments at the Royal Laboratory, Woolwich,
    a flotilla of boats was fitted out under his direction for
    the purpose of bombarding Boulogne Harbour with incendiary
    rockets from frames fixed on the decks. The first attempt
    ended in a fiasco owing to heavy weather, but the following
    year better results were obtained, although the rockets were
    deflected by the wind and did more damage in the town than
    in the harbour.</p>

  <p>In 1807 Congreve personally superintended their use at
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>Copenhagen with even better effect, and they were again used in
    the Walcheren Expedition and in an attack on the island of Aix.</p>

  <p>These rockets were all of an incendiary nature, with paper
    cases, and fired at an elevation of 55 degrees. Myer gives the
    proportion of the composition as 62.44 saltpetre, 23.18 charcoal,
    14.38 sulphur. This writer gives Congreve&rsquo;s rockets
    little credit for efficiency, but admits that they &ldquo;attracted
    great attention and were regarded as formidable.&rdquo; He remarks
    that at the siege of Flessingen &ldquo;the rockets acted so
    badly that the English themselves said that they did more
    harm to the battery than the besieged town.&rdquo; He also states
    that as a result of finding an &ldquo;unburnt specimen&rdquo; in the
    town after the bombardment of Copenhagen trials were conducted
    by Captain Schuhmacher, although how an unburnt
    rocket could reach the town is not clear; possibly he means
    from a reconstruction of the remains collected.</p>

  <p>These trials seem to have been successful, and in 1808 a
    rocket brigade was formed.</p>

  <p>In 1809 Admiral Cochrane used rockets upon the town
    of Callao, in 1810 they were used against Cadiz, and in 1813
    in the battle of Leipsic, where the commanding officer,
    Captain Bogeu, was killed, and at the siege of Dantzic. It is
    interesting to note that during that year they were used for
    propaganda purposes. At the siege of Glogau proclamations,
    etc., were printed on thin paper and fastened to the sticks
    with light thread. Rockets were used with effect at Waterloo,
    the rocket detachment being directed by Sergeant Dunnet.</p>

  <p>In 1813 Colonel Augustin, of the Austrian army, saw
    the English rocket batteries in action and trials of Congreve
    rockets in London, and the following year visited Copenhagen,
    where by arrangement between the two Powers he
    was instructed by Schuhmacher in his method of rocket construction.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span></p>

  <p>The Austrian Government as a result established shortly
    afterwards an extensive factory at Weinerisch-Neustadt for
    the manufacture of war rockets.</p>

  <p>Much work and ingenuity was expended about this time
    in seeking to eliminate the necessity of the rocket stick. Congreve
    is credited with introducing fins similar in action to the
    feathers on an arrow; this, however, had been done nearly
    one hundred years previously, and Frézier illustrates the
    method in his treatise.</p>

  <p>A Mr. Heath, of Boston, is credited with having reached a
    range of two and a half-miles with a five-pound rocket of this
    type.</p>

  <p>Garnier in 1813 proposed to avoid the alteration in position
    of the centre of gravity by using a wire or chain with a weight
    at the end fastened to the centre of the rocket and hanging
    vertically. From Ruggieri&rsquo;s book it would appear that this idea
    had often been tried previously.</p>

  <p>However, the most successful series of inventions were
    those based on the principle of the rifle, that to give the rocket
    a rotary motion in its passage through the air.</p>

  <p>In 1815 successful trials were made in America with rockets
    of the rotary type, rotation being imparted by means of holes
    bored through the case into the composition in an oblique
    direction.</p>

  <p>Congreve established a factory at Bow for the manufacture
    of rockets for the East India Company, and Captain Parlby,
    of the Bengal Artillery, manufactured similar rockets, both
    being made to rotate, probably on similar lines to the American
    model. The &ldquo;Calcutta Journal&rdquo; of the period contains a discussion
    of the rival merits of Congreve&rsquo;s and Parlby&rsquo;s rockets.</p>

  <p>Hale patented a rocket constructed on similar lines as
    late as 1844, the holes at the side of the case being nearly
    tangential. He also gave his name to a service rocket&mdash;Hale&rsquo;s
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>24 pr. and 9 pr. These were constructed of iron with a wooden
    head, fitted metal plug at the base with three vents, a tail piece
    or flange continuing from the base so as to enclose half the
    periphery of each jet. This arrangement imparts a rotary
    motion to the rocket.</p>

  <p>In 1853 Macintosh patented a method of rotating the tube
    from which the rocket was fired so as to give an initial rotary
    movement before the flight commences.</p>

  <p>The following year Fitzmaurice patented the idea of
    causing rotation by a screw-shaped head, and Court a method
    by which the fire impinged on surfaces inclined to the axis of
    the rocket.</p>

  <p>In 1826 Congreve patented a method of fixing two or
    more rockets together so that the heading of one ignited the
    next and so obtained a longer time of burning; this method
    is, however, again anticipated in Frézier&rsquo;s book.</p>

  <p>About this time all the leading Powers in Europe were
    manufacturing rockets for war purposes, factories for their
    manufacture being established at Warsaw, Turin, Toulon,
    and Metz. The Russians used them at this period in their war
    with Turkey, firing them in salvoes of nine.</p>

  <p>In 1831 a series of trials were made by the Swiss military
    authorities of 6 lb. rockets fired from a 6 ft. tube, when a
    range of from 18–1900 yards was obtained, and three hits
    registered out of five were made at 1,100 yards.</p>

  <p>Although great interest was aroused by the rocket for war
    purposes, it quickly subsided, and it is now practically only
    used for signalling and line-carrying purposes.</p>

  <p>William Bourne, who describes himself as a &ldquo;poor
    gunner,&rdquo; the first to produce an original book on artillery in
    this country, as distinct from translation of continental works,
    makes the following observations on military pyrotechnics:
    &ldquo;Divers gunners and other men have devised sundry sorts of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>fireworks for the annoyance of their enemies, yet as far as I
    have ever seen or heard, I never knew any good service done
    by it, either by sea or land, but only by powder, and that has
    done great service for that the force of it is so mighty and
    cometh with such a terror. But for their other fireworks it is
    rather meet to be used in the time of pleasure in the night
    rather than for any service.&rdquo;</p>

      MILITARY PYROTECHNY IN THE GREAT WAR</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span> outbreak of the great war, whatever may have
    been the case as regards other branches, found the
    Service badly equipped pyrotechnically. The great
    and almost frantic interest taken in military pyrotechny
    during the first half of the nineteenth century had died away.
    Gradually the pyrotechnic stores included in the official
    schedule had been reduced until in 1914 a few rockets&mdash;mostly
    signal&mdash;lights for signalling and illumination, Very
    pistol cartridges for signalling purposes, with single stars of
    various colours, and incendiary and light stars for shells constituted
    the entire list.</p>

  <p>The cause of this neglect of the art of pyrotechny for warlike
    purposes was not difficult to understand. Rifled barrels,
    breech-loading, and quick-firing ordnance had entirely
    destroyed interest in the rocket as a projectile. The telephone
    and telegraph had almost entirely superseded older methods
    of signalling, and so with most of the pyrotechnic contrivances
    which, less than a century before, had been thought to be
    indispensable.</p>

  <p>As events proved, this abandonment of old ideas was
    premature. Although every thinking man in the country
    realised that war was some day inevitable, no one, or at least
    very few, realised the nature of the struggle. The development
    of land war into what were practically siege operations
    on a gigantic scale; the nature of sea warfare with the new
    factors, the submarine, seaplane and wireless; the extent and
    ferocity of aerial warfare&mdash;all were unforeseen. Yet each of
    these called for new inventions, new methods of destruction,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>new methods of protection and communication, and in many
    cases the resuscitation of old ideas long since abandoned.</p>

  <p>And as fire has for all time been associated with the sword,
    it is small wonder that pyrotechny played no inconspicuous
    part in the struggle.</p>

  <p>As has always been the case, and no doubt always will be,
    the outbreak of hostilities was the signal for an epidemic of
    inventions. Men who had never before interested themselves
    either in war, or in that particular department of science to
    which their ideas belong, and in spite of or perhaps because
    of an entire ignorance of the subject, inundated the authorities
    with so-called inventions which were so much waste of time
    to all concerned.</p>

  <p>In this connection it is interesting to turn to a volume of
    &ldquo;Abridgements of Specifications relating to Fire-arms and
    Other Weapons,&rdquo; published by the Patent Office in 1859.
    The preface contains the following remarks: &ldquo;It is worthy
    of notice that a very large proportion of the so-called inventions
    of the present day are, in fact, old contrivances, sometimes
    modified and adapted to modern requirements, but
    very often identical with what has been tried and abandoned
    as useless long ago. From the year 1617 down to the end of
    the year 1852, not more than about 300 patents were granted
    for inventions relating to fire-arms. When the war with Russia
    broke out the Patent Office was inundated with applications
    for Letters Patent for similar inventions, and about 600 have
    since been actually granted. Of these it may be safely said
    that five-sixths of the applications related to old contrivances
    which have been patented over and over again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Many of these inventions recall a story of the Duke of
    Wellington, who was examining a steam rocket invented and
    patented by a Jacob Perkins in 1824. This device consisted
    of an iron case with a stick like that of a rocket. The case was
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>filled with water and had a fusible metal plug at the base. The
    case was heated, and when the plug melted the generated
    steam escaped and impinging on the air drove forward the
    projectile. The absurdity of the idea is too obvious to need
    discussion. The Duke carefully examined it, and after asking
    many questions, remarked: &ldquo;If this had been invented first
    and gunpowder afterwards, what a capital improvement gunpowder
    would have been.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The great war saw these &ldquo;inventions&rdquo; multiplied a
    thousand-fold. The spread of education, the availability of
    books from which at least a smattering of any subject could
    be obtained, and from the increase both in quality and
    quantity of newspaper news a consequent closer knowledge
    of what was happening&mdash;all these factors helped to add to
    the crop of ideas. In many cases undoubtedly these ideas
    were elaborated and worked out by the inventor, adopted
    by the authorities, and proved of the highest value. These
    cases were, however, greatly in the minority, and were generally
    the work of one who had at least some pre-knowledge of
    his subject. Such a man was the late Wing-Commander F. A.
    Brock, R.N.A.S., of whom it can be said without fear of
    contradiction no one man did more for military pyrotechny
    during the great war, and possibly in no other single subject
    during the war was one man so invaluable.</p>

  <p>Born in 1884, educated at Dulwich, he entered the firm
    of C. T. Brock and Co. in 1901, where he remained until the
    outbreak of war. Endowed with a marked inventive ability
    and a phenomenal memory, and brought up as it were in an
    atmosphere of pyrotechny, he developed a knowledge of pyrotechnic
    chemistry which was extraordinary and appeared
    almost instinctive.</p>

  <p>A naval correspondent, writing in &ldquo;The Navy,&rdquo; speaks
    of him as follows: &ldquo;From H<sub>2</sub>O to WO<sub>2</sub> they knew all
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>about it, or thought they did until the wayward genius of the
    Commander, who never pretended to be a chemist, taught
    them that there were permutations and combinations to the
    <i>n</i>th degree that they had never dared to think of.</p>

    <div class="caption">WING-COMMANDER FRANK ARTHUR BROCK, R.N.A.S.<br />
      Killed at Zeebrugge, April 23rd, 1918.</div>
  </div>

  <p>&ldquo;Wing-Commander Brock&rsquo;s great secret was originality.
    To the accepted formula he would add just a touch of the
    unexpected. The chemists would say it can&rsquo;t be done, or it
    wouldn&rsquo;t work. Sometimes it did not, but often it did, very
    nearly. And Brock&rsquo;s pioneer brain touched it a bit more&mdash;and
    lo! the impossible and the unexpected had arrived.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>During his connection with the firm he had travelled over
    a large portion of the world on its behalf. His experience at
    a comparatively early age in organising and carrying out large
    displays&mdash;where the safety of thousands of spectators is in
    the hands of the directing mind&mdash;no doubt did much to
    develop those qualities of self-reliance and self-confidence
    which were so marked a characteristic of his Service career.</p>

  <p>Wing-Commander Brock was responsible for many pyrotechnic
    inventions, and for the practical development of many
    ideas and inventions not his own, but which required technical
    knowledge and experience to ensure success.</p>

  <p>It is perhaps as the &ldquo;inventor of the smoke screen&rdquo; that
    he is best known, a quite mistaken idea, the fallacy of which
    a moment&rsquo;s consideration will show. There are many references
    to the use of smoke as a screen in classic times and even
    in mythology. The smoke ball, as we have seen, was a recognised
    military store up to the middle of the last century. It is
    just as absurd to credit Commander Brock, or for that matter
    any living man, with the invention of the use of the smoke
    screen in warfare as to credit the inventor of a patent fire
    extinguisher with the idea of putting out fires.</p>

  <p>What Commander Brock did do was to provide the means
    when the demand arose of producing smoke suited to the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>particular purpose for which it was to be used, whether for
    screens, signalling, or other purposes.</p>

  <p>As an example the &ldquo;E&rdquo; float may be cited. A demand
    had arisen for a smoke-producing device for use on board
    merchant ships to assist escape from enemy submarine
    attack. Commander Brock, with characteristic energy, in a
    very short space of time produced the &ldquo;E&rdquo; float, which for
    ease in manipulation by untrained operators and volume of
    smoke produced was probably unsurpassed by any subsequent
    device, and on the score of cheapness it undoubtedly
    held the field.</p>

  <p>This store, which was in reality a triumph of pyrotechnic
    design, was in appearance so simple as to mislead some at
    least to whom greater insight might have been credited as to
    the ingenuity of its design. Counsel at a sitting of the Royal
    Commission on Awards to Inventors, described the float as
    &ldquo;half-a-dozen or so drain rockets in a box.&rdquo; A remark which
    might be considered as accurate as to describe a clock as some
    pieces of metal in a box, were it not for the fact that the box
    in question contained no drain rockets, or anything resembling
    them more closely than one firework resembles another
    designed for quite a different purpose.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illow76" id="i168" style="max-width: 56.875em">
    <img src="images/i168.jpg" class="w100" width="910" height="1200" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Smoke Float in Action.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The requirements to be met were as follows: The apparatus
    was to be used by men whom by nature of their employment
    it was impossible to train individually, therefore its
    ignition must be simple and at the same time certain and quick
    in action, and carried on the float itself; a chamber had to
    be provided in which to as it were accumulate the smoke
    generated, which chamber had of necessity to have holes
    through which the smoke could issue. As the float had to be
    dropped after ignition from the deck of the vessel into the sea,
    and would consequently be submerged for a short time, these
    holes must be in some way sealed until the float rose to the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>surface. The pyrotechnic compositions which produce the
    greatest volume of smoke were found to take some considerable
    time to attain their maximum of production, and separate
    units had to be included which would develop almost instantaneously
    a big mass of smoke, pending the generation
    of the main supply.</p>

  <p>In addition, the float must be so constructed as to remain
    efficient when stored on the deck of a merchant vessel in all
    weathers and conditions.</p>

  <p>Two hundred thousand of these floats were issued during
    the war.</p>

  <p>The subject of smoke is one which naturally attracts the
    attention of the pyrotechnist, although in what might be called
    a negative direction.</p>

  <p>For display work the elimination of smoke is obviously of
    greater importance than its production, but inquiry into the
    one of necessity leads to a knowledge of the other.</p>

  <p>In some few cases the smoke generated is of value in adding
    to the effect of the burning composition; the most noticeable
    case of this is the use of coloured fire as flares, that is to
    say, burnt in masses for the illumination of trees and other
    natural features. Some years ago Messrs. C. T. Brock &amp; Co.
    spent considerable time in eliminating as far as possible the
    smoke from coloured fire, when it was found that without the
    smoke the result was very poor. It was the reflection of the
    colour on the smoke upon which the illumination depended
    for its effect. This, however, is hardly germane to our subject,
    but is mentioned to indicate how largely the question of
    smoke enters into the work of the modern pyrotechnist.</p>

  <p>Commander Brock had, apart from his ordinary work,
    been engaged for some months prior to the outbreak of war
    on the question of the production of smoke for the Admiralty,
    and had also interested himself in the subject for commercial
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>purposes, such as insecticide and other uses. He was therefore
    in a position, when the demand arose for smoke both for
    naval and military use, to start research in the matter considerably
    ahead of other inquirers, and to produce immediately
    a smoke that would supply the needs for the time being
    until more satisfactory means could be evolved.</p>

  <p>The Royal Naval Experimental Station at Stratford, of
    which he was in command and which he organised and
    brought into being, had many activities besides smoke. But
    even the exacting work of controlling its many activities was
    not sufficient for the Commander&rsquo;s untiring energy; the
    few moments he could snatch from his duties and the many
    he stole from sleep were devoted to the invention and elaboration
    of war devices. His greatest achievement was the
    Brock anti-Zeppelin bullet, for which he and he alone is
    responsible, and which beyond any shadow of doubt delivered
    this country from the terror of the Zeppelin raids.</p>

  <p>His other inventions include many purely pyrotechnic
    smoke devices and inventions connected with the production
    of smoke, such as igniters which were used to start the action
    of smoke production, the Dover flares of one million candle
    power each, used by the anti-submarine patrol in the Straits of
    Dover, and burned to the extent of several hundreds every night.</p>

  <p>He was also responsible for several forms of stars for use
    in Very pistol cartridges.</p>

  <p>Captain Carpenter, V.C., in his splendid book, &ldquo;The
    Blocking of Zeebrugge,&rdquo; writes as follows of his work in connection
    with that operation:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;It would be difficult for anybody to speak too highly of
      Wing-Commander Frank A. Brock. He was a rare personality.
      An inventive genius, than whom the country had no better,
      it was his brain that differentiated this blocking enterprise
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>from all previous attempts in history in one most important
      particular. The difficulty of reaching the destination in the
      face of a strenuous opposition had hitherto brought failure,
      but he provided an antidote in the form of a satisfactory artificial
      fog designed to protect the blockships from the enemy&rsquo;s
      guns during the critical period of approach. That in itself
      was a wonderful achievement, but his inventive mind was not
      satisfied therewith. To him we owed the special flares intended
      for turning darkness into light.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;A special buoy was wanted&mdash;one that would automatically
      provide its own light on being thrown into the water. Brock
      made so little of the problem that he produced such a buoy,
      designed, constructed and ready for use in less than twenty-four
      hours. Special signal lights were required: Brock produced
      them. Flame projectors, far exceeding anything hitherto
      known, were mooted: Brock produced them also. No matter
      what our requirements were Brock was undefeated. With a
      highly scientific brain he possessed extraordinary knowledge
      of almost any subject. He had travelled much and could tell
      you all that was worth knowing of any country from Patagonia
      to Spitzbergen. He was no mean authority on old prints
      and books, was also a keen philatelist, and was blessed with a
      remarkable memory. Wherever he went he carried with him a
      pocket edition of the New Testament, which was his favourite
      possession; his knowledge of the contents was quite unique.
      And with it all he was a great shot and an all-round sportsman.
      His fine physique was well remembered by many a Rugby
      footballer from the days when he played in the pack of one of
      the leading club fifteens. His geniality and humour were hard
      to beat. But of all his qualities, optimism perhaps held first
      place. At times we, who were far from being pessimistic,
      thought his optimism excessive, but it was justified absolutely
      with regard to the success of the enterprise.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span></p>

  <p>The &ldquo;Very&rdquo; was a pre-war invention, patented in 1878;
    it was not adopted into the Service until about ten years later.
    It consists of a short-barrelled pistol of 1 inch calibre&mdash;or
    rather that was the original size, a 1&frac12; inch pattern was introduced
    during the war, and subsequently a 1&frac12; inch pattern
    with a longer barrel and shoulder piece.</p>

  <p>The original cartridge was in effect a single star Roman
    candle, fired by percussion. A small propelling charge drove
    out a single coloured star, either red, white, green or blue.
    The star rose to a height of about 300 feet. These were used
    purely for signalling purposes.</p>

  <p>The war suggested another use of the &ldquo;Very&rdquo; pistol,
    that is for illuminating purposes, and various illuminating
    stars were introduced, both to light up upon reaching their
    objective with a range of two to three hundred yards, and to
    hang suspended from a parachute, similar to the old parachute
    light ball, but with many times the brilliance, although considerably
    less in size.</p>

  <p>The difficulty of identifying coloured stars in daylight suggested
    the use of coloured smokes. These were successfully
    evolved by Major Wicks and Captain Gray, an achievement
    of far greater difficulty than the casual observer might
    think.</p>

  <p>Apart from these synthetically prepared colours, the yellow
    smoke natural to orpiment was much used in signal stars.</p>

  <p>Later stars were suggested by Commander Brock, which
    ascended burning white and at their height broke into two, and
    in a subsequent pattern into three, stars of varying colours.</p>

  <p>The rifle grenade, which was fired by a rod fixed to the
    base of the grenade and running down the barrel of a rifle,
    being blown out by a cartridge without a bullet, was also
    fitted up for signalling purposes. Upon opening, a series of
    lights, arranged to code, were suspended from a parachute.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

  <p>Recognition and illuminating lights were constructed for
    use from aeroplanes, and were ignited by dropping through
    a launching tube fixed to the machine, which made contact
    and fired them electrically as they passed through.</p>

  <p>Landing lights and wing-tip lights, electrically ignited,
    were other stores used in connection with aerial warfare.</p>

  <p>Another was the incendiary bomb. Until the outbreak of
    war the incendiary composition for use as stars in incendiary
    shells was of a most primitive nature, and even during the
    war incendiary compositions were used which were ridiculous
    in comparison with those produced later.</p>

  <p>The construction also of some of the earlier efforts was
    quite as absurd. Projectiles were devised in a thin paper case,
    intended to be dropped from heights of many thousand feet,
    and ignite on impact, whereas the impact produced by the
    velocity of a projectile after such a fall was sufficient to
    scatter the case and its ingredients in all directions.</p>

  <p>It was the use of aluminium in pyrotechny which pointed
    the way to real incendiary composition, composition which
    exceeds the temperature of these primitive pitch and other
    elementary compositions by many times more than the flame
    of a candle exceeds the temperature of ice.</p>

  <p>Bombs containing thermit, and later on thermalloy (a
    composition which set hard, and did away with the necessity
    of a case), were terrible weapons, giving a temperature which
    has hardly been exceeded by other means.</p>

  <p>These compositions were almost identical with some of
    those containing aluminium used in pyrotechny for a considerable
    time before the war, but of course not for incendiary
    purposes. The intense heat is naturally accompanied by
    brilliant light, which was of great value to the pyrotechnists,
    the more so as aluminium compositions do not deteriorate
    on being kept as do those containing magnesium, and although
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>the light is not quite so brilliant, and has less actinic value,
    the fact that it is considerably cheaper, combined with its
    keeping qualities, renders it a very satisfactory substitute for
    that rather expensive metal, in very many cases at least.</p>

      THE CIVIL USE OF FIREWORKS</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span> utility of fireworks and the number of purposes
    to which they have been applied are far greater than
    most people imagine, both at sea, where possibly
    their usefulness is most fully exploited, on land, and since the
    war and its consequent developments of aeronautics, in the air.</p>

  <p>Firework signals at sea are used in almost endless variety
    for the purpose of identifying vessels at night. Each shipping
    line has its own signal or signals, which are fired on such
    occasions as when passing Lloyd&rsquo;s signal stations. These
    signals consist of hand lights, Roman candles, rockets, or
    Coston lights. The last-mentioned is a small hand light which
    is arranged to burn with either one colour or two or more
    colours in succession. This signal is used by the majority of
    foreign vessels. The signal used may be either lights burnt
    singly or together, or a light or lights burnt in combination
    with Roman candles or rockets. By making use of the various
    combinations a great number and variety of signals have been
    arrived at: a few typical examples will illustrate the kind of
    signals used.</p>

  <p>The Zud-Amerika Lyn of Amsterdam burns a white light
    at stern, green at bridge and blue at bow. The White Star have
    a green light at bow and green at stern. W. Johnston and Co.,
    a green light followed by a Roman candle, throwing three
    red and three blue stars, followed by a white light. The Aberdeen
    have a red light followed by a Roman candle, throwing
    red, white and blue stars three times successively, shown from
    aft. J. L. Burnham and Co., a blue light changing to white,
    then to red, followed by a red star.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span></p>

  <p>The Cunard Line, off the coast of Ireland, fire a blue light
    followed by two golden star rockets. The Ulster Steamship
    Co. fire three vertical lights, yellow, blue and red, followed
    by two Roman candles fired together, each throwing two
    yellow, two blue and two red stars.</p>

  <p>These examples will give some idea of the variety of signals
    used; they are often followed by another signal, or rather have
    a suffix which if fired has a particular meaning. For instance,
    a red light after the signal may mean &ldquo;All&rsquo;s well,&rdquo; or a green
    may signify a wish to communicate. Some lines bring the
    whistle into the signal and combine long and short blasts
    with pyrotechnic signals.</p>

  <p>Besides the house signals there are some generally accepted
    signals used by all vessels. A blue light is the signal for a pilot
    in all waters, except those of the United States. It is curious,
    however, that no universal pyrotechnic signal of distress has
    yet been arranged, although in 1889 Mr. F. Crundall endeavoured
    to get a standard distress signal recognised by shipping
    throughout the world. This signal, which consisted of a Roman
    candle surrounded at the mouth by four lights which burnt
    simultaneously with it, was demonstrated before the Board
    of Trade, and was distinguishable across the Channel at
    Dover, but was, however, not universally adopted.</p>

  <p>Another extensive field use of pyrotechnic signals at sea is in
    the fishing industry. Lights and rockets are used to communicate
    between vessels of the fishing fleets and with the carriers.</p>

  <p>The use of such signals by the coastguard and the Lifeboat
    Institution and at harbours and ports throughout the
    world is also very great.</p>

  <p>Another pyrotechnic store of the greatest utility is the line-carrying
    rocket, a device which has been responsible for the
    saving of thousands of lives.</p>

  <p>The credit for suggesting this use of the rocket appears
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>to belong to a Mr. Trengouse, of Cornwall. This was in 1807.
    The proposal did not, however, make as much headway as it
    should have done, owing to the fact that Capt. Manley had
    that year introduced a device with a similar purpose, the line
    being carried by a shot fired from a mortar. This idea had
    been previously worked out by a <abbr title="Sergeant">Sergt.</abbr> Bell of the Royal
    Artillery and by La Fère, a Frenchman, the two working independently.</p>

  <p>The Manley apparatus was officially adopted, and stations
    established at forty-five positions round the coast.</p>

  <p>The rocket method was, however, revived in 1826 by a
    Mr. Dennett, of Newport, Isle of Wight, and four stations
    were established on the island for the use of rockets of his
    pattern. The advantages of the rocket over the shot apparatus
    are obvious&mdash;the lightness and mobility of the rocket trough
    as compared with a mortar, the fact that the rocket traces its
    own flight, which can be seen and followed even at night,
    not to mention greater simplicity in working. However, it
    was not until 1855, when a rocket of greater range was invented
    by <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Boxer, of the Royal Laboratory, that the rocket
    as a line carrier came into its own.</p>

  <p>The Boxer rocket consisted actually of two rocket cases
    joined head to tail, and so arranged that when the first case
    had burnt out it was blown off, and the second gave renewed
    impetus. This rocket is still in use at the Board of Trade
    rocket stations.</p>

  <p>A further development of the line-carrying rocket which
    is making rapid headway is a compact apparatus designed for
    use on the wrecked vessel to carry a line to the shore.</p>

  <p>This system has two great advantages, namely, the target
    is so much greater when firing from the ship, consisting as it
    does of the whole coast line, whereas the ship forms in comparison
    an insignificant mark from the shore. Again, a vessel
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>is generally wrecked on a lee shore, so that in firing from the
    ship the rocket travels with the wind.</p>

  <p>Both the Brock and Schermuley systems are designed for
    this purpose, and there is little doubt that in a few years all
    vessels will carry their own means of establishing communication
    with the shore.</p>

  <p>As a further development of the line-carrying rocket, it is
    interesting to note that Congreve, in association with <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>
    J. M. Colquhoun, took out a patent for the use of the rocket
    as a harpoon in whale fishing, which, if it proved satisfactory
    in use, must have been a marked advance, especially as this
    was before the advent of the now universally used harpoon
    gun.</p>

  <p>Another pyrotechnic invention responsible for the saving
    of many lives is the Hale&rsquo;s Light apparatus. This apparatus is
    fitted to a lifebuoy, which is arranged for launching from a
    vessel&rsquo;s bridge; the act of launching ignites a flare, enabling
    the person in the water to see the buoy and the rescuing boat
    to pick them up.</p>

  <p>The practical use to which fireworks have been put on
    land are many. Probably that which comes most readily to
    the mind is the sound signal or alarm. Many fire brigades
    whose members are volunteers and therefore scattered use
    aerial maroons to warn and call them for duty. These maroons
    became familiar to Londoners during the air raid period in
    the late war.</p>

  <p>The maroon has also been adopted for firing with a trip
    line as a burglar alarm, or for protecting game preserves or
    similar purposes.</p>

  <p>Another well-known pyrotechnic sound signal is the fog
    signal used on the railways, which consists of a tinned iron
    envelope containing a mixture of chlorate of potash and red
    phosphorus. It is secured in position on the rail by two lead
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>clips provided for the purpose, and is fired by percussion on
    the impact of the engine wheel. Bird scarers, consisting of a
    series of single crackers connected by a time fuse, and so
    arranged as to fire at regular intervals, have been much used
    for the protection of seed and crops.</p>

  <p>The miner&rsquo;s squib and chieza stick or fuse lighter are to
    all intents port-fires for lighting the fuse in blasting operations
    in mines, their form and composition being adapted to the
    particular circumstances of their use.</p>

      The crowd at &ldquo;Brock&rsquo;s Benefit&rdquo; (64,000 persons present).</div>
  </div>

  <p>The use of pyrotechnic compositions for photographic
    purposes is well known; those in use at the present generally
    contain magnesium, which has greater actinic value than any
    other firework composition.</p>

  <p>Magnesium lights fitted up to fire with a trip line have
    been successfully used for obtaining photographs of big game
    in their native surroundings at night.</p>

  <p>Smoke pyrotechnically produced has for several years been
    used for the testing of drains, and recently successful experiments
    have been carried out establishing the value of smoke
    as a protection for fruit blossom against frost.</p>

  <p>It has also been used as an insecticide for use against
    various kinds of parasites; a poisonous smoke has been found
    of great use in the dislodging and exterminating of rats.</p>

  <p>Another agricultural use of pyrotechnic, or in this case
    perhaps more correctly explosive composition, is the use of
    explosive cartridges for ploughing; that is, cartridges are
    exploded at a certain depth in the ground, the effect being
    to break up the subsoil. The explosive used is a mild and
    cheap form of dynamite.</p>

  <p>The use of rockets and other explosive fireworks for producing
    rain has been much discussed recently. Many writers
    deny the possibility of success by such means. There cannot
    be the slightest doubt, however, that given clouds in the right
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>condition and altitude it is quite possible to cause rain. The
    writer has seen it done, not once but many times; generally
    it must be admitted when the rain was not wanted. Maroons
    fired in wide-mouthed mortars have been used on the Continent
    for some years to break up hail clouds and bring them
    down in the form of rain over the vineyards, where a hail storm
    is a serious calamity to the wine grower.</p>

  <p>The use of pyrotechnic signals in connection with aerial
    travel is gradually increasing. The stores used are practically
    those evolved and adopted during the great war, modified in
    some cases to suit peace time requirements, but substantially
    they are those described in the chapter on Military Pyrotechny.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        &bull; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.
    </div>
</div>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
